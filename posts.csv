All i hear from are word of mouth and just newspaper reports. So want to ask if any1 here actually saw those stuff» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «aneh di langit Klang tahun 1992 yang mungkin korang dah lupaHampir 25 tahun dahulu pada Oktober 1992, ada sekumpulan 200 orang pelajar dan guru-guru dari sekolah agama di Klang telah mendakwa dorang nampak beberapa objek aneh di langit. Bukan satu dua, tapi 26 buah secara keseluruhannya. Daripada bentuk janin bayi, mayat yang dikafankan dan beberapa lagi objek yang boleh buat korang kecut perut bila tengok.Apa yang dorang nampak sebenarnya?Sumber dari wonderwordz.comPeristiwa ini berlaku pada 9 Oktober 1992 apabila 200 pelajar dan kakitangan Sekolah Agama mendakwa yang dorang melihat mej aneh muncul secara tiba-tiba di langit sekitar jam 11.30 malam hingga 3.00 pagi.Budak-budak ini mula perasan tentang kehadiran objek tersebut ketika dalam perjalanan pulang ke asrama selepas menghadiri kelas prep. Objek itu jelas kelihatan dengan berlatarbelakangkan merah walaupun ketika itu langit dikatakan gelap tanpa bulan dan bintang.Dalam masa dekat 4 jam itu, dorang nampak rambut perempuan yang sedang berlari ditarik, sayap burung berkibar, perempuan berwajah khinzir, kala jengking, dua orang bergaduh kemudian bersalaman, lelaki berserban sujud ke arah Kaabah apabila yang lain membelakangi Kaabah dan sujud ke arah belakang Kaabah.Inilah 26 objek yang dorang dakwa telah nampak. Sumber dari Utusan Malaysia.Bukan takat itu je, dorang juga telah melihat kalimah Allah, manusia berkepala anjing, batu nisan, janin, manusia, mayat dibungkus, sebiji mata warna merah seperti orang sedang marah, lidah panjang, lidah dipotong dan disambung semula dan yang ini dorang cakap telah ditayangkan sebanyak tiga kali.Tak habis lagi ni, dorang nampak jugak peta Malaysia terbalik di mana Singapura terletak sebelah atas, botol arak, salib bertukar menjadi kubah, ayam, seekor ikan, peta negara Arab, mayat yang dah siap dikafankan, burung, orang berdoa dan tangan ingin mencapai sesuatu tetapi gagal dan di tapak tangannya pula ada tanda bulat.JAIS sendiri mengakui bahawa kejadian ini memang benar berlakuBetul atau tidak cerita ini tadi, memang banyak benda-benda pelik yang berlaku di Klang lepas tu. Malah ramai mula taksub dengan bendalah ini sampaikan ada yang bina 3 bijik kapal besar kerana beranggapan bahawa Klang akan mengalami banjir besar yang dahsyat.Inilah salah satu kapal yang di bina di Klang oleh Ajaran Sulaiman (Bahtera Nabi Nuh) yang kini terbiar selepas pergerakan kumpulan dorang diharamkan Jais. Sumber dari salamperantau.blogspot.myYang sedihnya, mereka yang terpengaruh dengan cerita ini tadi telah menyumbang dalam kutipan derma kilat yang dilancarkan sampaikan dorang berjaya menyiapkan 3 buat kapal.Bukan takat itu sahaja, oleh sebab pada tahun 1992 WhatsApp dan WeChat tak wujud lagi, ada pihak yang mengambil kesempatan dengan menjual gambar-gambar objek aneh ini tadi untuk keuntungan dorang sendiri.Tapi, tak boleh jugak nak salahkan masyarakat 100% kerana pada awal kejadian ini pihak Jabatan Agama Islam Selangor (Jais) sendiri telah memperakui bahawa kejadian ini memang benar-benar berlaku.Daripada siasatan awal Jais, dorang telah mengumpul maklumat dengan menemubual 11 pelajar serta empat guru dalam kejadian ini dan mendapati keterangan semua saksi adalah sama serta tidak bercanggah.Sumber dari Utusan Malaysia.Sehubungan itu, Jais pada sidang media 10 Oktober 1992 mengumumkan bahawa dakwaan kemunculan 26 objek aneh di langit seperti disaksikan 200 pelajar dan beberapa guru itu adalah benar dan bukannya rekaan.Kisah ini dianggap benar pada mulanya mungkin kerana kejadian ini berlaku kepada pelajar sekolah agama, malahan jumlah dorang ramai sehingga 200 orang. Dengan rekod jalan penceritaan yang sama, mungkin itu yang menyebabkan pihak JAIS mengesahkan kejadian ini.Kejadian aneh ini juga mula meninggalkan kesan psikologi yang mendalam terhadap kumpulan pelajar berkenaan. Mereka ketakutan sehingga tiada lagi selera makan, asyik menangis dan beribadat dengan membaca al-Quran, berpuasa dan solat.Jabatan Perdana Menteri kemudiannya bagitahu benda ini semua satu penipuanKecoh jugaklah Malaysia masa itu dengan peristiwa ini. Keadaan yang tidak terkawal dan panik dalam kalangan masyarakat akhirnya telah memaksa Bahagian Hal-Ehwal Agama Islam, Jabatan Perdana Menteri (BHEAI-JPM) pula melakukan siasatan.Laporan akbar yang mengulas tentang kejadian ini apabila pihak JPM mengumumkan kejadian tersebut adalah palsu. Sumber dari Berita HarianDan akhirnya dorang mengisytiharkan bahawa kejadian Objek Di Langit ini hanyalah satu penipuan dan rekaan semata-mata.Laporan yang dorang keluarkan juga mengesahkan objek di langit itu hanyalah khayalan kumpulan pelajar sekolah agama hasil daripada pendewaan dorang terhadap sorang guru agama kat sekolah tu yang dipercayai menyebarkan ajaran sesat.Siasatan JPM juga menunjukan bahawa pemikiran pelajar ini tadi telah dipengaruhi menerusi pendekatan pendewaan supaya apa-apa sahaja yang dikatakan oleh cikgu dorang adalah benar. Kiranya dorang kena brainwash lah dengan ustaz kat sekolah tu.Bukan takat itu je, JPM juga telah mengesahkan ustaz yang terbabit pada malam tersebut turut terlibat dalam aktiviti kumpulan sesat iaitu Ajaran Sulaiman (Bahtera Nabi Noh) dan dia jugalah yang menjadi dalang dalam kutipan derma untuk membina bahtera sebagai persediaan dorang untuk hari kiamat.Laporan salah satu akbar tempatan tentang kejadian tersebut. Sumber dari Berita HarianDari segi sains, betul ke peristiwa ini boleh berlaku?Betul atau tidak peristiwa ini terjadi, kami interview sendiri Prof Madya Dr Nani Fadzlina, pensyarah dari Fakulti Kejuruteraan Elektrik, Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM), bagi mendapatkan pandanganya dari segi sains.Menurut beliau, peristiwa ini memang ada kemungkinannya untuk berlaku melalui pelbagai fenomena alam seperti The Morning Glory, Light Pillars dan Fire Rainbows di mana ianya terhasil daripada konfigurasi tertentu di muka bumi.Tindakbalas antara cahaya, kelembapan atmosfera dan keadaan persekitaran juga memainkan peranan penting dalam pembentukan setiap fenomena ini. Contohnya seperti fenomena The Morning Glory yang terbentuk apabila tekanan atmosfera yang rendah di sesuatu kawasan menyebabkan berlakunya pelanggaran particle.Ia seterusnya menghasilkan gangguan gelombang bergerak yang merupakan bahagian penting dalam pembentukan awan dan disebabkan gangguan ketika pembentukan awan ini tadi maka terhasillah fenomena janggal atau pelik pada pandangan manusia.Tapi tak semestinya semua itu betul kerana fenomena The Morning Glory biasanya hanya berlaku di Teluk Carpentaria yang terletak di Utara Australia dan sangat-sangat jarang sebenarnya ia berlaku di tempat-tempat lain di dunia.Sumber dari wired.comKatanya lagi, begitu juga dengan Light Pillars dan Fire Rainbows dimana fenomena ini hanya djumpai di kawasan bersalji dan gunung berapi sahaja. Namun tidaklah mustahil fenomena ini juga berkait dengan apa yang 200 orang pelajar ini nampak pada tahun 1992. Semuanya di atas kebesaran Allah SWT.Kesimpulanya, susah sebenarnya nak merumuskan bahawa peristiwa ini memang benar-benar berlaku atau tidak, ditambah pula dengan kenyataan JAIS dan JPM yang bercanggah dan memeningkan masyarakat. Walaupun kisah objek di langit ini sudah lama berlalu, namun ianya masih kekal menjadi salah satu misteri bagi masyarakat Malaysia sehinggalah ke hari ini.Drawings in linkhttps://soscili.my/misteri-26-objek-aneh-di...orang-dah-lupa/1 thing that i like that time, jpm got balls to deny religion agency claim.

Speaking to Channel NewsAsia in an exclusive interview on Tuesday (Mar 14), Malaysia's navy chief, Admiral Ahmad Kamarulzaman, said the cooperation is unprecedented and reflects the level of trust and confidence among the three nations. ""We first discussed it a year ago and now, we are looking at launching our first joint operation from Sandakan sometime next month,"" said Admiral Ahmad. ""The three navies of Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines will be working together.""This is unique in the sense that not very often can you achieve this level of consensus, showing that all sides are serious in mitigating the challenges at sea especially due to kidnap for ransom and other cross-border crime.""The initiative in the Sulu Sea will involve not just maritime patrols, but also air patrols of the waters and coastline, said Admiral Ahmad. It is modelled after the current multilateral patrols in the Strait of Malacca that have successfully lowered the number of piracy cases reported to ""almost zero"", the navy chief stated.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has also given Malaysia and Indonesia the green light for the ""hot pursuit"" of militant boats in Philippine waters. He said that if authorities in Malaysia identify militant vessels, they can chase them even into Philippine waters.sosOh, and welcome to V24."

Critics say the real number is much higher.- AFP/de"

Texchem owns 51% in Dim Sum Delight, while the remaining 49% reportedly belongs to a Malaysian company owned by Angel Chong and Kelvin Khoo.For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2016 (FY2016), Dim Sum Delight incurred a loss of RM895,642, and is not expected to turn around in the near future"", Texchem said in a Bursa Malaysia filing today.""Given that the current retail market remains soft and competitive, the board of Dim Sum Delight is of the view that the prospects of Dim Sum Delight is very challenging and this situation is not expected to change anytime soon.""Accordingly, the shareholders of Dim Sum Delight are of the opinion that Dim Sum Delight should cease its business operation to minimise losses,"" Texchem added.Texchem, which also operates Sushi King and Goku Raku Ramen restaurants, said that at this time, it is unable to ascertain the extent of the closure costs associated with the cessation of its restaurant business. Texchem will provide updates on this matter in due course, it said, adding that its board of directors, having considered all aspects, is of the opinion that the cessation is Texchems best interest. There are two Tim Ho Wan restaurants in Malaysia: one in Mid Valley Megamall, and another at 1Utama Shopping Mall. Separately, Texchem also said its 94.87%-owned subsidiary Ocean Pioneer Food Sdn Bhd has signed two pacts  a sales and purchase agreement, and a machinery purchase agreement  with SHT Marine Frozen Sdn Bhd to sell a piece of leasehold land and related equipment in Setiawan, Perak, for RM2.65 million. Texchem said the sale will unlock the value of the assets, and is part of its strategy to strengthen its financial position. Shares in Main Market-listed Texchem rose one sen or 0.71% to close at RM1.42 today, giving it a market capitalisation of RM176.22 million."

Tiga berkromosom XX, dua berkromosom XY, salah seorangnya ialah Langit.Cikgu Harfa masuk kelas malam ini untuk mengajar pelajar tentang sistem respirasi manusia.Studen, malam ini kita akan membincangkan tentang perihal sistem respirasi manusia. Jadi siapa boleh beritahu apa organ respirasi manusia?Senyap. Bunyi anjing menyalak di luar, semua persetan.Tiada siapa yang tahu? tanya CIkgu Harfa.Sepi. Bunyi kucing menderam nak bercat-fight, semua persetan.Dilihatnya Langit sedang ber-texting. Seorang budak perempuan India bernama Vijaya sedang ber-camwhoring. Seorang perempuan Jawa, namanya Soci, sedang men-doodle notakaki pada buku Biologinya. Budak Cina obes bernama Bo Chan sedang tidur (pada waktu yang tidak sepatutnya) dan seorang budak gagap sedang engrossed dengan PSP, bermain Metal Gear Solid.Cikgu Harfa hanya mengeluh.Mereka memerlukan sedikit dorongan untuk memahami Biologi. Harap rancangan aku untuk malam ini mampu memberi efek dalam hidup mereka. Mampu menjadi turning point supaya mereka boleh faham Biologi. getus Cikgu Harfa.Cikgu Harfa meneruskan syarahnya, tanpa seorang pun yang membayar perhatian.Tiba-tiba, Vijaya terbatuk-batuk dengan kuat.Dengan sangat teruk.Kenapa dengan kamu Vijaya? Kamu asma ke? Bronchodilator ada dalam posesi saya. Kamu mahu pinjam? tanya Cikgu Harfa.Tak apa, cikgu. Batuk biasa saja.Baiklah. Seperti cikgu kata tadi, respirasi manusia sangat kompleks dan sangat delicate. Satu interupsi dalam ekuilibrium mampu menyebabkan kematian. Mari cikgu beri satu contoh. Vijaya, mari ke depan. panggil Cikgu Harfa.Vijaya terpiat-piat seketika sebelum bangun dengan ragu-ragu, menuju ke depan kelas. Semua pelajar tertanya-tanya akan contoh yang dikatakan Cikgu Harfa.Baiklah. Vijaya, silakan duduk. Orait studen, seperti yang anda dapat lihat, Vijaya merupakan seorang manusia, dan terdapat satu sistem respirasi yang sedang berfungsi dengan baik di dalam dadanya. Cikgu Harfa melurutkan kedua-dua tangannya ke bahu dan dada Vijaya.Secara maniac-nya Cikgu Harfa tiba-tiba memegang leher Vijaya dan mencekiknya. Matanya terbeliak seperti pelacur yang sedang senggugut.Vijaya meronta-ronta tanpa suara. Peti vokalnya sempit di-asfiksiasi jari jemari Cikgu Harfa.Satu kelas termangu dan terpinga. Kemudian, serangan panik melanda semua. Soci meraung seperti banshee naik syeikh. Bo Chan mencarut-carut dalam dialek Hakka sambil tangannya mendail sesuatu. Polis atau bomba atau ambulans agaknya. Budak gagap pula melompat-lompat setempat sambil tergagap untuk menyebut Cikgu Harfa dah gila, mukanya merah menyala. Langit mencari sesuatu untuk dibaling pada Cikgu Harfa.Cikgu Harfa sekarang sudah sawan babi. Mulutnya berbuih-buih dengan liur putih, dan kuku jarinya yang merah panjang mula menusuk ke dalam daging leher Vijaya. Darah mula membuak keluar dari mulut Vijaya macam orang kena sula. Vijaya semakin lemas, matanya sudah jadi putih permata.Langit sepantas kilat grab PSP budak gagap lalu membalingnya ke arah Cikgu Harfa. Dia jatuh, ditarik graviti lalu tersembam ke lantai. Sawan babinya semakin akut, badannya kekejangan seperti katak yang direnjat elektrik dalam eksperimen bodoh Volta.Vijaya jatuh juga, ditarik graviti lalu tersembam ke lantai.

It feels like the writers are more concerned with making themselves look hip and cool rather than the audience comprehending what the hell the story is about. This is reminiscent of the days of trashy Malay novels in the 90s, who are more concerned with using obscure Malay words in their writing to make themselves feel poetic and shit. Maybe they keep doing it because they dont have a good story to tell.I come from the generation of latecomers to the works of Tamar Jalis and Tok Awang Ngah with their more direct approach to storytelling though, so I may be biased. The only other non horror novel that I remember enjoying reading is 'Tulang Tulang Berserakan' by Usman Awang'."

Anyone using this Coway water filter? Which one ofodel u using? Any contract need to sign for certain years?

UAE, Saudi, Kuwait, Norway, Canada, heck even Bruneians average household income is higher than us. Look at Japan, South Korea, HK, Singapore and Taiwan. They had nothing.

""We have over 14 universities and our literacy rate is over 90 [%] - the highest in Africa,"" he said, adding that the economy was improving""We have more resources, perhaps more than the average country in the world."" Mr Mugabe said, during a panel discussion on fragile states at the World Economic Forum on Africa in South Africa's costal city of Durban.""We have a bumper harvest, maize, tobacco, and other crops. We are not a poor country,"" Mr Mugabe added, while acknowledging that Zimbabwe had problems.Last year, more than four million people were in need of food aid in Zimbabwe after rains failed. The country was once known as the breadbasket of southern Africa.The opposition accuses Mr Mugabe, who has ruled since independence in 1980, of ruining the economy.Zimbabwe has faced a severe cash shortage since last year and has introduced so-called bond notes as a substitute for the US dollar, the main currency people use.Hyperinflation forced the government to abandon the Zimbabwean dollar in 2009.After Mr Mugabe came to power in 1980, he was widely praised for improving access to education in the country and in the 1990s, it did have among the highest literacy rates in Africa.However, schools have also been affected by the country's economic problems and rates have now dropped back.----------------------I think we better vote BN next election, they never lied like this.

And most will make use of it.regarding Donations, Everyone gets it to fund their political campaign  and so on.UMNO did not attack Mahathir in account of him being their former leader. And Umno(under Pak Lah and Najib) did not attack Dap in account of not wanting to stir things up. But Since Dap keeps on with their barrage of attacks. Pm Najib, might have to be on offense mode now too.

MinisA mini or regular-size ecigarette is usually the newcomer's first choice, because these models look and feel similar to a cigarette. A mini is a good way to try out the system at minimum cost.Although they have a million brand names, they are all in fact models with a recognised series number that distinguishes them from others by their thread type and fit. In other words a 'Whizzocig' will turn out to be a KR808 or whatever. If you know the model series then you can mix 'n match parts from other vendors since they will almost certainly fit - there are no proprietary models despite what the makers may claim; all have a model number.These are called 1st-generation models as they were the first to be invented. Originally all these models used the 3-piece system, with a battery-atomizer-cartridge. Now about 95% use the 2-piece system of battery-cartomizer. A cartomizer combines the atomizer and liquid reservoir in one unit.Polls tell us that about 8% of forum members continue to use these models frequently, although many more keep one as a back-up or loan model. The batteries range from 125mAh size up to about 280mAh.A mini is a good choice for discreet use, and as an initiation to the ecig concept. If a model is chosen that looks exactly like a cigarette - white with a red LED tip - then it can be used where you would smoke a cigarette; but don't try using it indoors because people will assume you are smoking and no amount of explanation will fix it as there is bound to be confusion or resentment from some. Instead, get a black one with a blue or green tip, it will create less problems because it is harder to confuse with a tobacco cigarette.The models include the 510, 901, M401 and KR808 (often shortened to KR8).Advantages:Looks and feels like a cigaretteSmall and discreetAuto and manual modelsCheapest way to get startedParts can be re-used if you know the model typeIdeal for light smokers or occasional smokersDisadvantages:Batteries do not last long in use - from 45 minutes to 2 hours for some usersThe other two physically larger classes have better performanceWill probably not provide sufficient performance for heavy smokers or full-flavor smokersThe auto batteries can be destroyed by liquid leaking due to over-enthusiastic refilling2. Mid-sizeThe mid-size ecig is the #1 rated model type because it suits most vapers, either as the main device or the main back-up. The common names are eGo, Riva, Tornado, kGo and others.These 2nd-generation models have a much larger battery size of at least 650mAh. This has three important results:The batteries last longer in use;They produce more vapor than a mini;They can use a much wider range of heads, including - crucially - the LR type, which produce more vapor. All kinds of tanks and other exotic heads can be used (the liquid reservoir and mouthpiece arrangements).Most of these models are based on the 510 range although some use the KR8 thread.This is the type upon which all ecig measurements and values should be based: it is the average in all respects - probably about three-quarters of forum members either use one as their main device or keep one as a back-up.Advantages:Not too expensive to get started - maybe 50% more than a miniThe 510 series threading most used has a huge range of headsThe small, 650mAh battery is reasonably small for those who want it discreetLooks and feels like a cigar, so it's not too bigDouble the performance of any mini - double the vaporBatteries last well in use, the bigger batteries around 1,000mAh can last up to 8 hours for some vapersShould provide sufficient performance for most smokers, especially newcomersThe #1 rated type of ecig for good reason - suits more users than any other typeDisadvantages:Almost exclusively these are manual ecigs - a disadvantage to newcomers although an advantage to experienced usersSlightly more expensive to start out withUltimate performance is not possible as the battery power/voltage is not sufficient3. APVsAdvanced personal vaporizers (aka 'mods') are the logical progression and development of the ecig concept for those who want ultimate performance. They can be defined simply as any model that employs user-replaceable generic batteries and/or has a function not normally available in a mini or mid-size e-cigarette. There are two main classes of APV: the tubular shaped tubemods and the box shaped boxmods, and three sub-types: mechanical, basic electrical or electronic.hey do not normally suit newcomers because they are too big, or weird-looking, or too fiddly to use; plus all are manual-switch models. These are 2nd-gen or 3rd-generation devices. Almost all have a hugely extended battery life over the minis, and they mostly use generic 3.7 volt lithium rechargeables that can be bought from many sources. An APV will normally look like a fat tube reminiscent of a flashlight with a mouthpiece (a tubemod), or a box the size of a pack of cigarettes with a mouthpiece (a boxmod).the big advantage is the performance that large batteries deliver, plus the advanced functions and features that are variously available according to the individual model: integral liquid feed, digital readout, variable voltage, full electronic control, solid metal construction, or attractive wooden construction with inlays, and so on.We suggest that an APV is not purchased as the first model by a newcomer, but instead a mid-size (or mini) is first used to gain familiarity with all the many aspects of vaping. This also has the advantage that there will be a better appreciation of the many issues if choosing an APV later on.Advantages:Massive performance gains: three times or more than any mini - treble the vapor volumeExtended battery lifeSolid constructionSome of the base units may last a lifetimeThe advanced functions are extremely usefulBatteries last a very long time in use, the average is 8 hours although some can last for daysWill provide sufficient performance for any smokerDisadvantages:Expensive to set up with - some base units are over $200, though there are many far cheaperThese are all manual models - a disadvantage to newcomers although an advantage to experienced usersSome care with battery charging is needed, as large lithium ion cells need treating with respect[b]Guide to Vape Safe !! » Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «WHY BATTERIES EXPLODE:- mech mods with LOW AMPERES BATTERIES & LOW OHMS (NEW TO VAPING DO NOT USE MECH MODS!)- unbranded batteries that CLAIMS HIGH AMPERES (Max. continuous discharge current HIGHER THAN 30A WITH HIGH mAH!- heat shrink HAS been damaged but did not replace CAN cause explosion due to battery will VENT!HOW TO VAPE SAFELY:- USE GENUINE & BRANDED SUCH AS LG (CURRENTLY RATED #1), SAMSUNG (#2), SONY (#3) AS OF NOW!- MAKE SURE THERE'S NO HEAT SHRINK DAMAGE ON THE BATTERY!

Hasil yang akan dapat adalah 50/50 6mg.Nota: 50/50 bermaksud ratio PG:VG adalah 50:50. Kalau PG 1ml, VG juga 1ml.Bahan2 yang diperlukan: Botol plastik kosong Balang kaca 100ml (boleh pakai balang kaca RM1.50 yang beli di kedai kek) PG Nic (dilarut dalam PG) VG (banyak sikit dari PG) Banyak syringe besar dan kecik. Satu syringe untuk satu bahan sahaja. Coffee foam maker (di Mr. DIY ada, RM6.90 atau di Ikea - Ikea punya tak payah tekan lama2 pasal ada suis on kat tepi) Bateri AA rechargeable dan charger (murah di MR. DIY) Dripper (optional, tapi senang untuk test dan adjust)Flavouring cadangan untuk beginner: TPA/TFA Vanilla Swirl TPA/TFA Strawberry Ripe TFA Bavarian Cream Sucralose (untuk pemanis, ako cadang 1/2 titis setiap 5ml) Ethyl Mathol/EM/Cotton Candy (untuk bagi ""body"" kepada flavour krim) Citric acid (untuk menyedapkan sesetengah perasa buah, 1 titik untuk 5/10ml. kalau lebih, nanti jadi masam)Dengan flavour di atas korang boleh buat at least 3 jenis ejuice: Strawberry ejuice Creamy Vanilla ejuice Strawberry aiskrimStep 1: Buat premix nic baseAda orang yang tak suka buat premix dahulu, dan ada yang suka. Pada ako, ako pemalas. So bila dah ada premix, hanya tambah flavour dan VG sahaja. Senang untuk orang baru (dan lama) untuk buat banyak2 ejuice.Bahan yang diperlukan: 48mg Nic 21ml VG 50ml PG 30mlUntuk orang yang pemalas, boleh mix semua ni. Hasil akan dapat LEBIH KURANG PG/VG 50/50 10mg base. Untuk orang yang nak premix base yang tepat, pakai sukatan ini: Nic 20.83ml VG 49.5ml PG 29.67mlStep 2: Buat ejuiceUntuk buat Strawberry ejuice 10ml, resepi adalah: 20% TPA/TFA Strawberry Ripe - 2ml 60% Premix base - 6ml 20% VG - 2ml 2 titik suc (sikit sangat, % diabaikan)Untuk 30ml, kali 3. untuk 50ml, kali 5. untuk 100ml ejuice, kali 10 (Strawberry Ripe perlu 20ml contohnya). Buat batch besar macam 100ml bila rasa ejuice dah sedap.Goncang secukup rasa. Tunggu bubble hilang, lepas tu cuba. Kalau buat 50ml/100ml, senang sikit pasal boleh pakai coffee foam stirrer tu je.Untuk Strawberry Ice Cream pula, resepinya adalah: 12% Strawberry Ripe 5% Vanilla Swirl 2% Bavariam Cream 1% EMUntuk Creamy Vanilla: 12% Vanilla Swirl 12% Bavarian CreamUntuk semua resepi, tambah sucralose ikut sedap tekak sendiri.Step 3: Test dan adjustLepas buat 10ml batch, cuba test dekat dripper. Kalau tak cukup manis, tambah setitik lagi sucralose, goncang sampai cramp tangan, dan test lagi. Ulang sampai sedap. Boleh pakai cara sama untuk citrik asid.Nota: Kalau hanya pakai flavour buah, selalunya boleh test straight away lepas bubble dah hilang. (atau lepas letak botol dalam air separa panas selama seminit dua). Kalau biar seminggu, lagi sedap.Kalau flavour berkrim, kena peram lama sikit.Step 4: Kalau rasa takde kickKalau takde kick, ada 2 sebab:Flavour tak cukup %PG kurang (pasal perasa tak cukup kuat rasa)Alternatif: Daripada buat 50/50 6mg, buat 70/30 6mg20% flavour - 2ml60% premix base - 6ml20% PG (ganti VG) -2mlAlternatif #2: Tambah penguat rasa/flavour enhancer (akan ditulis bila ako rajin, di masa akan datang tongue.gif)Vaping Chart» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «Founder:» Click to show Spoiler -

I went to the talk (thanks to my boss) last time, help me alot in making my personal, marriage and work life better.Other than that, proly ur mom felt anger and release to other is because of the side effect of drugs she took. Some drugs can result to unstable emotion. Lastly, dont feel down. Pick urself up and think rationally. Dont make any move base on ur emotion as it will usually end up with a bigger mistake"

He don't want us to take care but he have no choice but to let us. After he recovered, he turn back into his happy chill self.I think this is normal.

""The plane started shuddering then there were a couple of loud bangs and a lot of light,"" he said.Mr Joga, 31, was sitting on the right hand side and said he heard about ""four or five bangs"" coming from the direction of the right-side engine, before he reported seeing flames coming from the engine.""I could see an orange light coming from the windows,"" he said. The plane landed at Brisbane Airport a short time later where the Airbus A330-343 was being examined, according to witness photographs supplied to Fairfax Media. Newlyweds Malissa Siaea? and her husband were on-board heading for Thailand for their honeymoon. ""It started making funny noises when we were getting ready for take-off,"" she told Fairfax Media.""About 20-minutes into the our flight fire sparked out of the right-side engine.""""Then the plane swooped a little bit and started shaking badly.""She said not many passengers even realised there was a problem until a man yelled out ""What the heck is happening?""Mr Jago said passengers remained calm and unlike a recent Air Asia X flight where the pilot urged passengers to pray as the flight experienced trouble, a traveller instead urged a celestial plea. ""Someone said the engine's on fire and we should pray but mostly everyone remained calm and everyone clapped when the plane landed safely,"" he said. Asked if the incident would deter him from flying with budget airlines in the future, Mr Jago, who paid less than $600 for a one-way ticket from New Zealand to India via Australia and Malaysia, said it would not. ""I'm not fussed about living or dying,"" he said and described the mid-air encounter as ""exciting.""Just last week Air Asia X launched an investigation into what caused the mid-air safety scare on flight D7237 on June 25, when passengers reported engine failure. The flight, also bound for Kuala Lumpur, was turned back to Perth.  The company said it complied with all safety standards set by the countries it operates in, including Australia. The investigation, being conducted in conjunction with engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, is expected to take months."

Teknologi push button tu, tahun 2004 lagi dah ada. Perdana sampai hari ini masih start pakai kunci. Cuba pandu Vios dikelajuan 180km/j. Mesti isteri kat sebelah mengomel, ""jangan bawa laju laju bang"" Bunyi angin bukan main kuat. Seram. Kalau lalu line kanan di highway, kereta belakang mesti tembak lampu tinggi. Tak pun, kena sondol. Sebab kereta anda tidak cukup performance. Kan dah tak boleh kejar masa. Pasrah. Handling goyang. Kena badan terlalu letih, mata mengantuk. Nak cari R&R, jauh lagi. Silap hari bulan, terbabas. Sistem keselamatan tidak mendukung sebab mampu beli low spec saja - Risiko kematian tinggi sekali. Semua ini tak terjadi pada kereta buatan jerman itu. High spec. Kelajuan 200km/j, masih boleh lepas dua tangan untuk check allignment lagi. Tidur anak insyaallah tak terganggu. Tapi bukan bermakna pandu laju itu bagus. Hanya buat perbandingan dari aspek performance dan keselamatan.Kalau tiba-tiba terlanggar lubang atau obstacles yang ganggu handling, dia ada sistem utk luruskan balik kenderaan. Bagi yang ada jiwa sport, kalau berselisih dengan vellfire, nissan GTR, camry, hilux turbo, honda civic, volkswagen itu boleh bagi salam perkenalan lah. ? Besok nak jual kembali, harga vios BARU jatuh 50%. Kalau ini, paling 10 - 20% sahaja. Lantaran ia sudah melepasi susut nilai tahun pertama. Artis yang pakai BMW model E90 ini setahu saya, Wak doyok. Orang fesyen.Tapi kereta dah make up habis. Bagi saya, tiada originaliti. Tahun masih dibawah."

5,Smoochy poohh,"  Jul 2 2017, 10:47 PM",New Member,Group: New Member,Posts: 0,Joined: Aug 2016,From: Raub  Seremban,"Baru-baru ini muncul iklan dari seorang individu yang berkata membeli sebuah BMW 3-Series E90 adalah jauh lebih berbaloi dari membeli sebuah Toyota Vios.Menurut iklan beliau, dari membelis ebuah Toyota Vios, adalah lebih baik membeli sebuah BMW 320i E90 kerana Vios adalah sebuah kenderaan yang tidak begitu sempurna berbanding dengan BMW (memang sebuah Vios tidak patut dibandingkan dengan sebuah BMW, baik di bumi atau di planet-planet lain),  dan adalah lebih bijak untuk membeli sebuah BMW 3-Series terpakai.Mungkin beliau sedikit ""over"" di dalam iklan tersebut kerana ada banyak faktor yang tidak dikongsi - contohnya harga insurans, harga alat ganti, jumlah penyurutan nilai dan juga fakta di mana ia memerlukan seorang pemilik yang rajin untuk melayan sebuah kenderaan Jerman terpakai.Rakan Careta dari Page Auto Stylista di Facebook, Kamarul Ariffin Nor Sadan nampaknya berfikiran sama seperti kami dan beiau tampil menasihatkan orang ramai agar jangan mudah terpedaya.Kamarul sebenarnya memang memiliki sebuah BMw 3-Series E90 dan kerana itu, pengalaman beliau memang boleh diterima-pakai.Teruskan membaca komentar Kamarul yang dimuat-naik di dalam laman Facebook beliau. kamarul BMWKamarul dan BMW E90 beliau.  Sebagai pemilik BMW E90, aku sarankan agar kau orang tak terperdaya dengan penjual seperti ini.Aku beli E90 LCI tahun keluaran 2010 pada tahun 2012 di BMW Premium Selections kira secondhand tapi melalui Auto Bavaria.Masa ambil, odometer baru 8,000km. Ada warranti lagi setahun. Lima tahun aku guna kereta ni aku boleh kata kereta ini bagus.Aku berpuashati dengannya, cuma pemilikan kereta ini tak seindah gambaran yang dihebahkan. Beberapa perkara kau kena tahu: 1. Harga: ?RM80,000 hutang vs RM75,000 tunai. Bukan mudah kumpul wang tunai sebanyak RM75,000. Kalau kau ada wang tunai sebanyak itu, elok kau guna duit itu untuk beli kereta terpakai yang masih boleh buat pinjaman bank dan bayar harga muka tinggi, selebihnya kau laburkan. 2. Waranti: ?BMW terpakai tahun 2010 mestilah dah luput waranti. Kereta baru ada warranty sehingga 5 tahun. Jika kewangan baru nak stabil, jangan peningkan kepala pakai kereta tiada warranty. Kecuali kau beli kereta terpakai yang kos selenggara rendah. Semestinya bukan BMW E90. 3. Alat ganti: ?Sparepart reconditioned boleh dapat murah, tapi kena rajin cari sendiri. Kalau kereta dah rosak, nak kena cari lagi sparepart sendiri, memang niaya. Sparepart Taiwan pun murah, tapi apa guna beli kereta kualiti Jerman tapi semua pakai parts Taiwan yang tak authorised. Baik beli kereta tempatan tapi alat ganti asli. Bergaya jangan sampai poket papa kedana. itu kurang bijak. 4. Tayar: ?Sesetengah spec E90 tiada tayar spare. Ia pakai tayar run flat bermaksud kalau pancit boleh jalan beberapa puluh kilometer lagi dengan kelajuan terhad. Harga sebuah tayar run flat untuk size untuk E90 ni mececah RM1,200 sebiji. Aku tukar kepada tayar biasa, sebab tak mampu. Kalau pancit, terpaksa panggil tow truck. Lagi satu, saiz tayar pun tak begitu mudah di cari.BMW E90 side 5. Penjimatan bahan api: ?E90 320i mempunyai enjin 2.0L. Kecermatan minyaknya tak akan sama dengan enjin 1.5L. Mesti 2.0L lebih tinggi sedikit. Lagi-lagi kalau suka bawa macam pelesit, seperti yang dianjurkan dalam pos penjual. Jangan nanti dah beli E90, merungut setiap minggu sebab harga minyak naik. Dan bila pandu macam pelesit, komponen akan perlu ditukar dengan lebih kerap! 6. Lain-lain: ?- Ada ciri lampu tutup sendiri jika lupa matikan lampu selepas enjin dimatikan, namun namanya bukan LED Angel Eye Technology.?- Kesenyapan kabin (NVH) E90, terutamanya jika spesifikasi dengan rim 18"" dan tayar run flat, tidaklah begitu hebat. Kalau versi M-sport, NVH lebih teruk kerana springnya keras. Dan Vios baharu sudah mempunyai lebih banyak alatan canggih seperti keyless entry, push start button dan lain-lain. Paling penting, Vios ini ""reliable"" dan menjimatkan minyak! Kesimpulan:Hati-hati dengan janji manis penjual. Dia cerita yang indah-indah sahaja. Tak usah percaya semua yang dia kata.Maaf jika saya kata, jika budget kau mampu beli Vios baharu RM80,000 secara pinjaman bank, maka anda belum mampu beli BMW E90 terpakai pada harga RM75,000 secara tunai. Oh ya! Cuba teka harga brake pad ori E90 berapa? Eh jangan kata boleh pakai brake tak ori pula.Credit : Careta http://careta.my/article/pemilik-bmw-e90-j...i-bmw-dari-vios"

RTD has also had dialogues with them.So this kind of dialogue must be seen as the governments action, Liow told FMT.He said the government had always taken into consideration all the views of the taxi associations.They can make a request and we always heed them.We always welcome this kind of dialogue or town hall meetings.Liow urged taxi drivers who wish to meet the transport ministry or SPAD to come up with constructive suggestions and views.He said with the rapid change in technology, the taxi drivers ought to embrace the changes, including the introduction of taxi apps.Liow said the government was now helping taxi drivers to modify the way they did their business.This was the reason why SPAD is amending the law to register Uber and Grab services to allow them and taxis to operate on an equal platform.A taxi drivers association earlier today said BN politicians had not spoken up for the welfare of taxi drivers and the concerns they have, questioning if the ruling government wanted their support in the coming general election.Klang Valley Taxi Association chairman Zailani Isa Usuludin said not a single BN politician had shown any interest in the welfare of taxi drivers in the country.No BN politician has approached us and asked about the plight of taxi drivers.Instead, only opposition party leaders have shown an interest and were present during our demonstrations, Zailani said today at an assembly by the Malaysia Taxi Drivers Congress held at the Civic Centre in Petaling Jaya today.In March, taxi operators and drivers gathered to protest against the Uber and Grab e-hailing services in front of the Parliament building after submitting three memorandums.About 200 drivers came and protested, occupying the pedestrian path on the left and right side of the bridge leading to the Parliament building main gate.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...f-taxi-drivers/"

And then I guess, Adele holds the record for the most fucks in a Glastonbury appearance.Now I love Adele, but guess what..?Dave then led the crowd in a chant of fuck fuck fuck, surpassing Adeles f-bomb total in the process.During Adeles Wembley Stadium show, she also paused for a serious moment, during which she called out the neglect that the residents of Grenfell Tower have experienced in the wake of the tower block fire earlier this month.She also hinted that her most recent tour could be her last, in a heartfelt message to fans."

In fact, the economic growth projection for 2018 and 2019 has also been revised upwards to 4.9 per cent and 5.0 per cent, an increase of 0.4 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively, he said.Recently, a Bloomberg report titled, The Ringgit Is Easily Asias Strongest Currency, has put the Malaysian ringgit as the most stable major Asian currency in the first quarter of this year.At 6pm today, the local currency was traded at 4.2965/2995 from 4.2920/2950 compared with the US dollar last Friday.Touching on the FDI, Najib said, 2017 also witnessed huge FDI flows into the country, a sign of investors confidence in Malaysias economic strength.If in 2016, we had succeeded to bring in a lot of foreign investments from China, a result of my visit to the republic with the signing of memorandum of understandings (MOUs) worth RM144 billion, we have received more foreign investments not only from China but also Saudi Arabia, India and others, he said.He said the country has received some RM31.08 billion in investments  following the first visit of Saudi King Salman Abdulaziz Al-Saud.The investments came through Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Saudi Aramco) in the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) project in Pengerang, Johor, he said.Beside the foreign direct investments, King Salman also showed interest to increase three-fold the scholarships for Malaysian students to study in Saudi Arabia and increased the haj quota from 27,900 to 30,200, he said.Najib said his visit to India resulted in the signing of 31 MOUs worth RM158.4 billion, and through letters of intent worth RM1.6 billion.Although the Malaysian economy received recognition from internationally-certified organisations and foreign investor confidence, there are economic experts from the Opposition who are tarnishing the countrys economy only for their personal political needs, he said.Najib said with the investments from China after his visit there, many from the Opposition had said that Malaysias sovereignty was sold to China, but surprisingly there were also foreign investments coming from Saudi Arabia, India and many other countries.""In reality, although the Opposition continues to spread allegations and false news to tarnish Malaysia and its economy, the government will be responsible and strive for the best for our rakyat. In this case, we will continue to welcome foreign investments as it will add value to our economy and also generate employment opportunities for the rakyat, he said.Najib said there were so many forums, roadshows, discussions, brainstorming sessions and sharing of ideas through social media for the first six months of this year with regards to preparing the country for the National Transformation 2050.Among the main projects for InfraRakyat are Pan Borneo Highway, High-Speed Rail Kuala Lumpur-Singapura, The East Coast Rail Line project and the Mass Rapid Transit.He said In the field of education, the government takes pride that five of the worlds top 300 universities were in Malaysia  Universiti Malaya, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Universiti Putra Malaysia and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.I have also launched the Bumiputera Education Exploration programme, where we seek out Bumiputra students who want to pursue further education but could not afford to do so, and give them an equal footing in their efforts to improve their lives, he said.Najib said in terms of improving the quality of life of the people, the government has introduced numerous initiatives in the first half of 2017, like the Lets Help The People programme, which involved providing the needy with basic home furnishing, restoring their homes and even building them a new one.""We have recorded numerous achievements, including creating a Digital Free Trade Zone and a Criminal Court for Sexual Crime Against Minors.These achievements are the result of the determined effort by all levels of society, from the top leadership right down to the grassroots and ultimately, the people on the street, he said.He said the government would increase its effort and strive to maintain the momentum of success and achievements, not only for the second half of 2017 but in the years to come.  Bernamahttp://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...s-strong-stable"

Higher top management gets increase in pay n allowence in thousands of ringgit n big fat bonus while the lower ranks get ciput increase only. The increase is not in tandem with the inflation. Bcoz of this, purchase power of mid n lower income group decreases and in return affect other businesses facing lower sales figures. Not to mention the high income probably spend more outside of malaysia. And to top it all, u apply gst on us. So dont bs us with those figures."
