He said theirs was the kind based on provocation as they wanted to portray Islam as a religion of extremists.“The extremists here, the pelampau kafir, (the true extremists) in our country is the chief editor of Nanyang,” he said, adding that non-Muslims should immediately stop “courting trouble” with the Muslims.When asked to comment on Nanyang’s public apology, Hafiz said, “Sorry is not enough.” He said the damage had been done and the cartoon was a deliberate attempt to provoke the Muslims.Hafiz said Nanyang should be given the harshest penalty as a deterrent to other newspapers, media outlets and social media users against engaging in such acts of provocation against the Muslims.“We cannot gamble with national security. Nanyang must be censured, cancel their licence, permit.“We do not care. Even if Utusan did it, they too must be punished.”Earlier, Hafiz and Gabungan Perwakilan Melayu Pulau Pinang president Mohd Rizuad Aizudin and Gabungan Bela Hak Islam president Mohd Noordin Mohd Nor presented a memorandum to Nanyang’s Penang office here at Weld Quay.Nanyang’s state advertising chief Beh Sok Hooi received the memorandum and told reporters that it would be handed over to their KL headquarters.In the six-point memo, the groups demanded Nanyang’s management sack the editor who approved the publication of the cartoon.Later, the group burnt photocopies of the controversial cartoon with the words “Biadap” (rude) written across it. A DAP logo was also placed in the middle.They later scooped up the ashes of the paper into a bag in a bid to “save the environment”.YTzs4z-t6J4--------------------------Already protest and burnt Nanyang Siang Pau infront of HQ 2 days ago, still mahu protest lagi?   What do these people get if minorities don't support this?"

damonlbs,20170415,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 371,200505,From: KL,"http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...esident-as-ape/Fahmi creates a stir with drawing of PAS president as apePETALING JAYA: Activist Fahmi Reza who got into trouble last year for depicting Prime Minister Najib Razak as a clown, has created a stir once again, this time for depicting the PAS president as an ape. Taking to Facebook yesterday, Fahmi uploaded a caricature of Abdul Hadi Awang as an ape, tearing up a cartoon published in a Chinese daily recently that depicted him as a monkey. PAS secretary-general Takiyuddin Hassan told FMT that he has not seen the caricature in question yet but that if the drawing is found to have defamatory elements, he would take the matter up with the party’s lawyers. “Like the cartoon published by Nanyang Siang Pau, we gave it to our lawyers for them to assess if we had a legal case against the daily. “It is our president’s right not be slandered, or portrayed negatively in that manner. So we reserve the right to take legal action if necessary,” said Takiyuddin. He said Fahmi’s caricature was a deliberate attempt to provoke PAS and divert the Islamist party’s attention from their true aim of safeguarding the well-being of the public and strengthening the country’s shariah courts. “But we won’t fall for it.” The caricature comes in the wake of a controversial cartoon published by Nanyang titled “Monkey Show Act” that featured two monkeys sitting on a tree labelled “Act 355”, a direct reference to the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1965. A group of monkeys are seen fighting below the duo. On the tree, one monkey wearing a songkok is labelled “Speaker”, while the other labelled “Hadi Awang” wears a turban.Although the Chinese daily issued a formal apology for the cartoon, and pulled it from its digital edition, various quarters from PAS and Umno have expressed their dissatisfaction and demanded that Nanyang’s publication permit be revoked. The Home Ministry has issued a show cause letter to the daily, claiming that the cartoon made a mockery of Parliament and Islamic matters and could affect public order. Meanwhile, Fahmi in a Facebook post today, asked for his social media followers and friends to voice their opinion of his “latest protest caricature” that “portrayed the PAS president as a monkey”. “I produced the drawing as a sign of protest against PAS and PAS’ supporters who practised censorship when they tried to stop a satirical cartoon published by Nanyang. “(It is) an action which I view as contradicting the freedom of artistic expression, and media freedom. “Do you guys feel offended with my monkey drawing? Do you think the caricature is excessive, too provocative, and should be deleted? If yes, why? If no, why?” Most of those who commented on the post said while they considered the caricature provocative, they supported Fahmi on the basis of freedom of expression. In fact, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s Youth chief Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman also voiced his support for Fahmi. In his comment, Syed Saddiq, said: “I don’t agree with the drawing. But I will still defend your right to draw it. “You’ve been consistent in using art as a means of expression. Najib, Tun M (Mahathir Mohamad), DSAI (Anwar Ibrahim), all have been drawn. “TGHA (Hadi) is no exception.”"

damonlbs,20170415,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 371,200505,From: KL,"https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/1682/Semua Cina adalah DAP, dan semua DAP akan masuk neraka?KARIKATUR beruk yang disiarkan akhbar Nanyang Siang Pau mengundang kemarahan ramai penyokong PAS. Meskipun speaker Dewan Rakyat turut digambarkan sebagai seekor beruk memakai songkok, orang ramai lebih meradang dengan gambaran beruk berserban yang ditinggalkan sendirian dengan sebiji ubi keledek panas.Jenaka keledek panas itu juga tidak dapat ditangkap umum, kecuali kalau memahami pepatah Cina mengenainya. Peribahasa Cina tentang memberi keledek panas, ertinya memberi sesuatu yang susah untuk ditangani. Ini tidak perlu dijelaskan dengan panjang lebar.Pelukis menggambarkan proses penggubalan undang-undang di Parlimen seakan beruk mempermainkan undang-undang. Karakter [ ???? ] secara amnya bermaksud ""kera bermain helah"" dan merupakan bidalan biasa dalam kehidupan masyarakat Cina. Namun dalam hal ini, karakter [ ? ] juga membawa maksud undang-undang.Pelukis mungkin cuba bermain-main dengan karakter Cina dengan menggambarkan episod tangguh bahas RUU 355 adalah seperti kera mempermainkan undang-undang. Fokus untuk menggambarkan bidalan Cina tersebut barangkali hilang sama sekali apabila semua orang menumpukan perhatian kepada dua kera di atas pokok itu.Tapi itulah. Beruk juga yang dipilihnya. Macam dah tak ada binatang lain.Namun apa yang lebih menggelikan hati ialah bagaimana dengan pantasnya jentera propaganda pihak tertentu menyebarkan betapa biadabnya karikatur akhbar Nanyang Siang Pau, dengan menulis perkatan BiaDAP menggunakan akronim DAP, bersekali dengan lambang roketnya.Sejak bila pula Nanyang Siang Pau dimiliki DAP? Eh takkanlah semua yang Cina perlu disabitkan dengan DAP? Bukankah itu pemikiran bodoh, jelik dan tidak berakal?Akhbar Nanyang Siang Pau (selepas ini disebut NSP) ditubuhkan pada 1923 di Singapura, dan merupakan antara akhbar berbahasa Cina paling tua dalam negara. Ia tidak pernah berhenti terbit kecuali untuk tempoh empat bulan pada 1923-1924, apabila penjajah British menggantung penerbitannya kerana terlibat dalam politik kepartian.Ketika Perang Dunia Kedua, NSP terhenti penerbitannya sepanjang 1942 hingga 1945. Ia hidup semula pada 8 September 1945.NSP juga mencatat sejarah sebagai akhbar harian berbahasa Cina pertama tersenarai di Bursa Malaysia, dan akhbar paling laku sebelum dipintas Sin Chew.Tapi itu semua sejarah yang sudah terlalu lama. Kita pastinya lebih berminat dengan sejarah lebih sezaman, contohnya bagaimana pada 29 Mei 2011, Nanyang Press dibeli oleh Huaren Holdings, sayap pelaburan Partai Cina Malaysia, MCA.Nanyang Press kini berpayung di bawah Media Chinese International Limited sejak April 2008 dipengerusikan Tan Sri Datuk Tiong Hiew King yang kebetulan orang kuat Parti Rakyat Bersatu Sarawak (SUPP). SUPP ini, secara mudahnya semacam MCA lah di Sarawak. Ke mana tumpahnya kuah kalau tidak ke nasi.Lalu, kenapakah DAP yang dimaki hamun?Jawapannya mudah saja. Kerana lebih mudah membingkai musuh dengan satu nama dan label, lebih baik lagi sekiranya nama dan label itu juga sarat nilai. Membungkus akhbar Cina dalam parameter DAP, Cina, kafir, makan babi (contohnya lagi) cara mudah untuk memadatkan sasaran.Kan senang kerja begitu? Semua Cina adalah DAP, semua yang DAP menentang Islam, dan semua yang menentang Islam masuk neraka. Khalas.Ini dilakukan timbalan ketua ulama Muslimin sedunia dalam satu ceramahnya di Rusila beberapa hari lalu sebaik saja mengumumkan dirinya berjaya diberi kepercayaan wakil rakyat beragama Islam daripada parti kerajaan untuk membentangkan usul persendirian bagi meminda Akta 355.Abdul Hadi Awang, selain melemparkan tuduhan dan kata-kata kesat sempat membingkai para penentang RUU 355 sebagai musuh Islam, dan mereka yang menyokong usaha terbabit sebagai kawan orang Islam.Hadi mungkin saja membaca tulisan George Lakoff, ""Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate"" sebelum mempraktikkan kemahiran membingkai ini.Cara Hadi membingkai hujah RUU 355 dalam ceramah sepanjang setengah jam itu memang sangat cemerlang dan harus dipuji. Membingkai hujah dengan kekisi agama adalah cara yang amat ampuh untuk memngolah persetujuan.Kalaulah Hadi diberi kontrak untuk memasarkan air Milo yang dibancuh dengan air zam zam misalnya, Hadi mungkin akan kata ""Belilah Milo ni. Siapa tak beli, kita tahu dia musuh Islam, dan siapa beli, kita tahu dia kawan orang Islam"".Orang tak akan peduli pun soal Milo bancuh dengan air jenis apa pun tetap menjadi air Milo. Dan orang akan tambah tidak peduli pun taukey milo tu presiden Umno, atau Malaysian Official 1 atau Jho Low.Sama seperti orang tidak peduli Nanyang Siang Pau itu sebenarnya bukan akhbar DAP pun. Inilah kuasa kemahiran membingkai. – 15 April, 2017.* Izmil Amri, berasal dari Pulau Pinang dan sering gagal dalam banyak hal.
