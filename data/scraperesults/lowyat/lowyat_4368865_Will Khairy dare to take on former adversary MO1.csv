Accusing Mahathir and Anwar Ibrahim of betraying Umno for the sake of acquiring power for themselves, blatantly undermines the historical record.“It also inadvertently boomerangs back to his immediate boss,” Dzulkefly said, referring to Umno president and Prime Minister Najib Razak.Yesterday, after opening the Kepala Batas Umno division meeting, Khairy went on the attack against the new Pakatan Harapan leadership line-up.“The principles of Pakatan Harapan have got nothing to do with the future of the country. They are only working together so each can become powerful. Mahathir and Anwar Ibrahim were former Umno leaders and now they are trying to break up Umno and the Malays.“We cannot have a government established on the basis and principle of wanting power, because it is not a sound foundation for any party,” Khairy was quoted as saying by Bernama.Dzulkefly also challenged Khairy to save Umno by taking on Najib himself.“If he truly loves and is relentless in not wanting to betray his party, he must take on Najib, now. That will be brilliantly statesman-like and being a genuine patriot.”Dzulkefly said even former deputy prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin and others from Umno had left to help put right the “betrayal of the party and the nation”.“Hence, accusing Pakatan Harapan as being power-hungry or power-crazy sounds hollow and stinks to high heaven.“Khairy’s antics are understandable however, as he has been blamed for not outrightly defending his boss, hence, he is unmistakenly frantic to show otherwise,” Dzulkefly said.“Still, that doesn’t warrant him to shoot from the hip and in turn only reduces him to his wannabe successor’s misdemeanour, that is, Jamal Yunos.”"

Since his bapak-in-law also in MO1's pocket now getting cushy jobs like DrM's former post in Petronas. It is also too late for KJ to make his move now (even if his bapak-in-law suddenly decides to go against MO1) as MO1 already consolidated his position. To have any chance, KJ will have to join forces with factions like Zahid faction"
