Pakatan Harapan will have Malay PM, assures Kit SiangPETALING JAYA: DAP supremo Lim Kit Siang has given his assurance that the prime minister’s post will be given to a Malay leader if Pakatan Harapan (PH) takes over the reins of the country.The Gelang Patah MP today claimed that Umno leaders and propagandists had embarked on a strategy to frighten the Malay electorate that a vote for PH would be one for DAP and for Chinese against Malays.He described this as a “sad and shocking resort to the politics of lies, hate and fear”.“The 14th general election (GE14) is not a battle between DAP and Umno, but PH versus the Barisan Nasional – and if Umno loses federal power, the prime minister will not be a Chinese but a Malay,” he said in a statement.Lim also accused Umno leaders of demonising him to the Malay public through the media.He said the demonisation reached “fever pitch” when Rural and Regional Development Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob accused him of “remote controlling” the MPs of the opposition coalition, including those of the Muslim faith.He claimed it was sad to see Umno and BN leaders, together with propagandists and cyber-troopers, “continuing to insult and run down their own race” by suggesting that top Malay leaders were of low moral character and calibre and had become puppets or stooges.He asked if they would next accuse him of controlling past Umno leaders like former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, and former deputy prime ministers Muhyiddin Yassin and Anwar Ibrahim, as well as others who were now also in PH parties.“Will they next suggest that former prime ministers Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tun Hussein Onn as well as former finance minister and former Semangat 46 president Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah had also been my stooges and puppets, victims of my ‘remote control’ or ‘mind control’ when we were working on a common cause in the national interests?”Lim, however, stressed he was not the ultimate target of the demonisation campaign.He said the real reason for the attacks on him was because Umno and BN elements were aware that PH stood a good chance of defeating them in GE14 and taking over the federal government.On Sunday, Ismail told reporters at a press conference in his Bera constituency that all decisions made by Pakatan MPs, including Muslim parliamentarians, were controlled by Lim.“Everything is ‘remote controlled’ by Lim Kit Siang,” he was reported as saying,“The public should be aware that if the opposition controls the government, everything will be controlled by Lim and the rest will be his puppets.”http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...ures-kit-siang/"

It is just the usual propaganda and usage of fear on some people.  DAP and Lim Kit Siang, the usual bogeyman.  Still works on some people......"
