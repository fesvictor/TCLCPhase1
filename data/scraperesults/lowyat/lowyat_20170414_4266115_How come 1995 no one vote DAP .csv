Those who play stock market at that time really eat shark fin with rice everyday.Today we are the sick man of Asia. Our economy is not only stagnant but regressing. Nobody bothers about Bursa anymore. Today eat nasi lemak with ikan bilis also difficult..

End of the day, all money transferred is actually money of share buyers, if you manage to sell higher, it's because there's other share investor willing to buy from you at such price. Without good dividend or good performance of the invested company, such speculative price cannot sustain, and no real profit is made."

What was the cause?"
VoidDance,20170414,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 7,201703,,"Ahh.. the early 90s. Worked at one of securities firm. So many stocks traded everyday we just literally could swim in stocks certs. The smarter part of me back then didn't take the opportunities to learn the rope and reap the rewards, letting the bodo part of me wasting money. Came out after SPM back then and making RM2k per month. Not even bought a motorbike. Now makan gaji only. Padan mukak."
