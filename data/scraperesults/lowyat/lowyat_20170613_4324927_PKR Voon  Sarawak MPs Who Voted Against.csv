neoexcaliber,20170613,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,Yet Sarawakians I know claim it's a ploy by Peninsular politicians to have the voting in the wee hours of the morning to make sure Sarawak MPs are too tired to think.   Their denial is so strong. Another source claimed only 1 MP from Sarawak voted against it so I'm not sure which is correct.

Wassupman,20170613,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 595,201303,,actually it really makes me wonder why they voted against the tourism tax which most probably only would cost something like from 10 - 300 / night kinda thing but they didn't vote against gst.... do they actually stay in hotels like 365 days? perhaps these guys visit the hotels like 300 days a year for a quick fix? seriously i cannot brain but nevertheless i also dont think its good to have the tourism tax.

IReallyNeed Answers,20170613,Krazeybender,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 887,200801,From: Cheras,"as bad as people make gst to be, it's actually a good thing, initial implementation is bad and messy, but none the less, it's beneficial.Gst is not created out of thin air, it's a replacement and improvement of current taxing scheme.It's exceuction and implementation is studied for years and are all inclusive Then you have this tourism tax, tertiba created, July cannot start then push to august, still cannot then sept.Macam main suka suka jer. On top of this, tourism taxes purpose and usage is vaguely structured. And yes, it probably cost about 5-20bucks more per room per night, but then, think about how most Malaysian works, if we can saved that money, we would.This couldn potentially reduce the local traveler, they shouldn't do this at time like this when they need to encourage local spending. They just see an opportunity, then they start milking again."

Toyoi,20170615,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 7,201302,From: ToyoiLand,"BN Minister: Sarawak MPs forced to pass tax bill, Wan Junaidi15 Jun 2017https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/4327130...KUALA LUMPUR, June 14 — Barisan Nasional ministers from Sarawak are obliged to support the ruling administration’s proposed laws, said a minister from the state after a Cabinet colleague questioned their previous silence on the Tourism Tax Act....Natural Resources and Environment Minister Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar explained that this was consistent with the principle of collective responsibility practised among Commonwealth states....“We Sarawakian MPs (who) are ministers cannot speak against the government’s Bill (Tourism Tax Bill),” he was quoted as saying by the Borneo Post news portal....“If you want to know why Sarawakian MPs did not voice out against the Bill, you will have to ask MPs who do not have any ministerial post.”"
Toyoi,20170615,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 7,201302,From: ToyoiLand,"Vote first, Bantah later...Sarawak BN party launches anti-GST signature campaign16 Oct 2015https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/3745731...A Barisan Nasional component party in Sarawak has launched a campaign to get the state exempted from the goods and services tax (GST)....SUPP's Kuching branch is hoping to garner 500,000 signatures from Sarawakians in two weeks with its ""Zero GST for Sarawak"" campaign, the Borneo Post reported....The signatures we collect will give a mandate for our chief minister to represent the voices of our rakyat to the federal government to say more action has to be taken because our people are suffering.vs.MP chides SUPP Kuching for petition on exemption of GSTSoS...“The GST Bill was passed in 2013 after the general election. All the opposition MPs were against it, but BN (Barisan Nasional) MPs including Sarawakian MPs all voted for it. Had the MPs from Sarawak voted against GST Bill, it would not be passed because they would not have gotten more than 51 per cent of the lower house....“Now that SUPP wants to launch a full campaign on this, the first thing they should do is to take action against Richard Riot as well as Senator Datuk Dr Sim Kui Hian for voting for GST. We do not want a scenario whereby your MP and Senator supported the Bill in Parliament when you try to be hero outside,” he told reporters outside Wisma Bapa Malaysia in Petra Jaya here yesterday....Chong described the move to gather signatures as ‘ridiculous’ and said SUPP Kuching was trying to fool the people on the matter....“It is a very laughable move on their part. Outside, you say you’re against it, but your MP in Parliament voted for it, supported it. This is what we call political cheat.”"
