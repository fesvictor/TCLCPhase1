Probably just taking a long lunch break but at least they're still in the area.That's way better than not being in attendance at all...which is a bit common with BN...Edit: Interesting. I note TS purposely omitted that bit...I wonder why...

I know mine is.If I don't like what she's doing, I can easily attend one of those and give her a piece of my mind. Fortunately for me, she hasn't given me any reason to do so just yet."

joe_mamak,20170525,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,No suggestion.  Better you get news from a wide spectrum.  Then see for yourself which are the ones that are more balanced in the reporting.  I don't want to suggest anything as it could predispose you to bias.
