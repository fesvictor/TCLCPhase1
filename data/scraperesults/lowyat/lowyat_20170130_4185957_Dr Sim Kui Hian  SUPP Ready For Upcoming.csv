Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Zahid Hamidi will be here on Feb 3, and Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak on Feb 9, so you (the media) ask them, ask the boss. If the boss says we campaign, we campaign,” he said when met at his Chinese New Year open house on Saturday.Earlier, Dr Sim said the practice of holding open house is a tradition among the multiracial people of the state to share joy and happiness with everyone, regardless of their race or religion.He added that the loss of the late Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Adenan Satem was still fresh in everyone’s mind, thus the Chinese New Year celebration was low-key.“I would like to wish everybody Happy Chinese New Year. This is a Sarawak tradition, we share with everybody, we’ve got different races coming together. I thank everybody who came to my open house despite the weather.”Among the visitors were Yang Dipertua Negeri Tun Pehin Sri Abdul Taib Mahmud, wife Toh Puan Raghad Kurdi Taib and family; former deputy chief minister Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Alfred Jabu Numpang and wife; Minister of Women, Family and Community Development Datuk Seri Rohani Abdul Karim, Minister of Industrial and Entrepreneur Development, Trade and Investment Datuk Amar Awang Tengah Ali Hasan and family; and Piasau assemblyman Datuk Sebastian Ting.http://www.theborneopost.com/2017/01/30/dr...tform=hootsuite"
