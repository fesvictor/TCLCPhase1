He said the minister must be “daydreaming” if he thought the matter had indeed come to a rest.He said by addressing the matter at the event, Johari would have the perfect opportunity to not only put the 1MDB issue to rest, but also to give Pua himself “a rest”.He said Johari was free to put forth his argument, as he did in the open letter, that “the spectacle of name-calling, not only towards me (Johari) but towards other members of the administration as well, is nothing less than embarrassing and demeaning to your (Pua’s) standing as a member of Parliament”.He said Johari could ask the voters of PJU directly whether they had elected him as their MP “to do better things than just being obsessed with 1MDB”.He added that no Barisan Nasional minister would offer him such an opportunity to attend their official events and get even 15 minutes to explain about alleged misappropriation of funds of some RM25 billion raised by 1MDB.“However, perhaps in my foolishness, I am giving Umno-BN an excellent chance to sign my political death warrant,” Pua said."
