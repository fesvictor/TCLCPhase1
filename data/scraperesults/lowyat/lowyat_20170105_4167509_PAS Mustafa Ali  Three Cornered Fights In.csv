As for Amanah, I suggest they do not enter the fray,” Mustafa was quoted as saying by the portal.With Amanah communications director Khalid Samad’s recent announcement that the party would contest all of PAS’ seats, this ensures three-way fights between PAS, Amanah and BN in the next general election (GE14).Seat allocation has been a touchy matter between parties in Pakatan Harapan, of which Amanah is a member, and the PAS-PKR alliance in Selangor.In 2013, PAS won 15 of the 21 state seats it contested and four parliamentary seats in Selangor.However, Morib assemblyman Hasnul Baharuddin and Hulu Kelang assemblyman Saari Sungib defected to join splinter party Amanah in 2015, along with three MPs, Khalid Abdul Samad (Shah Alam), Dr Siti Mariah Mahmud (Kota Raja) and Mohamed Hanipa Maidin (Sepang).On whether the three-way contests would strain ties with parties in Pakatan Harapan, Mustafa said the PAS-PKR alliance in Selangor would be unaffected.“However, there are still a few matters that need to be discussed with PKR, which I will not elaborate for now.”PAS vice-president Iskandar Abdul Samad said it was a pity that Amanah had been pushed into a corner to go against PAS.“Amanah has announced that it would contest in our seats, probably because DAP and PKR are unwilling to provide the party with any (seats). I can understand their predicament.“Amanah has no seats to contest in except PAS’. It’s a pity, but PAS is ready for them nonetheless.”PKR and Amanah leaders were unavailable for comment.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...elangor-likely/"
