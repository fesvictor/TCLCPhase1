silent_stalker,20170219,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 820,201204,,"This is just my take on the whole issue in general. Currently we can see religious bigots are using syariah law to forcefully increase the numbers of muslim in this country. Just numbers but not in practice. For example, 1 side parent can convert the child without the consent of the other parent, and if a child born from this forcefully converted child, that new child will also be a muslim. Once u are in, u cant get out. Even in death, example a family once tried to cremate a deceased but was stop by religious authorities that the dead guy had converted. Even when the family argued the dead guy never even once prayed and had always followed the current religion of the family. With just this move, muslim numbers will increase drastically in this country. 1 day the numbers can go beyond 70% ( currently we are at 60%). And when this time comes, some minority will voice out claiming they represent all the muslims in this country, and claim it is the wish of muslims in this country to have hudud or some other man made laws but claim it is from god. Some of u may think this is nonsense, but such argument had been used here numerous times.This is my fear. When the minority controls the majority, the only way to stay in power is by imposing fear. This is not nonsense. It has been proven in history lots of time. So dont say ""kalau tak buat salah kenapa nak takut"". To all those that support the nonsense PAS and other religious bigots, plz think carefully."

Also, it contradicts your defense of PAS and the RUU gathering. Why the need to rile up public support if public opinion doesn't matter? Shouldn't the people leave it to the experts instead of having a public event to pledge support? Perhaps in this one scenario, it's slightly better than regular common law drafting because public opinion is being taken into account before the amendments are debated."

AllnGap,20170219,[ Modding with Passion(tm) ],Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 3,735",200301,From: Penangites,"under nik Aziz at least there are balance under 2 factions, ulamak n progressive group. nik Aziz has always been anti umno since long time ago, maybe due to memali incident and a few fuck up after so called ""unity"" with umno.hadi however is always wanna get married into BN family.as I said earlier PAS doesn't have any value to umno except to split PH. umno also doesn't want to share seats/power with PAS.u see all these ""unity talks"" of hadi and najib dint yield anything at all.umno MP did not openly announce that they will support RU355.so umno will use PAS like a piece of tampon. after use will be discarded.polarisation inside PAS alone is a dangerous direction. why ? simply because as desperate as they get, more religion cards will be used.they can't get foothold of anything solid except religion.PAS will become a tame dog beside umno or a crazy dog once deserted.means at one extend, they will be shooting at anyone, umno included in order to expand this supporter base, so religion card will be used to attract those hardcore ppl from every party if they aren't taken care by umnodon't forget also UMNO's base from Sabah and Sarawak is mainly Christian seat as well. so that's why u see umno MP did not openly support RU355. have u seen umno MP at purple gathering there ? only PAS is there. BN cannot play too close too PAS if not that would affect Sabah n Sarawak sentiments too. so in terms of a chess game PAS is in a fucked up position. if in PH without splitting to amanah, they still have 2 states.now maybe can't get any foothold for next GE because of dilution from amanah.and u know why memali happened ? because PAS at that time threatened umno greatly. so good luck to PAS......"

Faidzal,20170219,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 234,200808,From: From JB to KL!,"1. just to correct you there on why nik Aziz hates umno.he hates umno bcos his son was wrongly imprisoned under ISA by UMNO (not nik abduh, another one, nik adli https://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nik_Adli_Nik_Abdul_Aziz)the other reason yes, I agree and help expand a bit, the time that UMNO 1st fucked up PAS good and proper was that 1970s darurat situation in Kelantan (when PAS was part of BN).that time it caused the 1st major breakup of PAS in which PAS also split into 2 with the other faction creating a splinter party called berjasa which teamed up with UMNO and won the Kelantan state election after darurat was lifted.and that was the time the ulama' faction (which was way different than today's ulama' faction) wrested control of PAS from the old guard into the new guard.that time the ulama' faction leader where moderates unlike now, and they were nik Aziz of course along with arwah fadzil noor and arwah yusof rawa (father of current amanah leader mujahid yusof rawa)...hadi awang was small timer back then, only that he once made speech about kafir mengkafirkan UMNO (the infamous amanat haji hadi) of which UMNO used to repeat every time during elections...    2. there were 2 or 3 prominent umno ppl, but only 1 of them was MP.I. jamil khir baharom (MP for jerai and Minister for Islamic affairs in the PM's dept.)II. senator asyraf wajdi dusuki (senator only, but he is deputy minister to jamil khir)III. syed hamid albar (SPAD chairman, former MP for kota tinggi iinm)"
