BS8110,20170724,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 1,201505,From: Somewhere on this Planet,"At least he acknowledge the pattern. Oppo can win urban areas but then to win general election is to have enough numbers of MP in Parliament, which still many seats still belongs to non-urban area.It is a game of numbers - you can win all the cities or towns but if the total number is still smaller than the other party, you will not going to form the federal government. The key if Oppo wants to win the election is the non-urban area, which means non-urban area issue and presence at rural area. Rural people basically don't care much things on national level or fat-fetch issue, what they concern more is on their daily livelihood - things that affect them directly. BN knows this very well and hold a good grip on it, which something Oppo have to put good strategy for it."

Wassupman,20170724,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 595,201303,,Seputeh has one of the biggest number of voters which can be easily delineated to min 3 seats but nothing has changed. Delineation only happened in all federal seats but not in opposition seats. I hope education and internet has caught up with Selangorians since the last election else Selangor will fall into the hands of federal.
