We will not forget this. May God make the path forward easier,” said Hadi in the closing speech of PAS’s muktamar in Alor Star, Kedah.The controversial bill was tabled after the government pushed it to the top of the Dewan Rakyat agenda. RUU355 became the first private member’s bill to be tabled in Parliament by an opposition MP. Hadi also hit out at other MPs who had attempted to derail the tabling of the bill in the Dewan Rakyat, saying that it will not deter him and PAS from seeing it through the law-making process.Although he successfully tabled RUU355, Dewan Rakyat Speaker Pandikar Amin Mulia halted and adjourned it sine die.“We will continue to push the bill and we warn all the MPs who try to block it, not to play around with Islam as it is the federal religion,” Hadi said. – May 1, 2017."
