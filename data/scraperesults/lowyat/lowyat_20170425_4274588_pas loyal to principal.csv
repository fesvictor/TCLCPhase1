In fact, PAS sits comfortably among the most important Islamist political parties regionally and globally.The origin of PAS is rather convoluted but the official account today is it was founded on Nov 24, 1951, at a meeting of Malay scholars and Islamic associations in Butterworth. The meeting was actually the third Ulama Congress, which in turn has its origin in Umno’s political strategy.Umno, under its first president Datuk Onn Jaafar, was getting worried about losing support from conservative Malay Muslims. It wanted to reposition itself so that conservative Malays would remain in its fold.When the Ulama Congress met again for the third time on Nov 24, 1951, the delegates agreed to the formation of Persatuan Islam Se-Malaya. This was the starting point for PAS.The first president was Haji Ahmad Fuad, who simultaneously held the position of head of Umno’s Religious Affairs Bureau. Despite PAS already being formed, the linkage to Umno headquarters continued through him. In fact, PAS even allowed for dual membership at that time, and many were members of both Umno and PAS.When he was first elected as president of PAS, Ahmad Fuad’s inaugural speech was entitled “Kita laksana sampah, kerana tidak bersatu” (We are like rubbish, because we are not united). He was calling for all Malays to unite under one banner, with the more conservative ones in PAS, but ultimately everyone would still be under Umno’s big umbrella.[/B]Malay unity, therefore, is not at all new to PAS. That was their founding agenda.In reality the majority of PAS’ membership is conservative and they have always remained the same. The changes made by the progressives only affected the top layer of the party. But when the conservatives decided that enough was enough, their strike was decisive. In 2015, the progressives were completely routed from all posts and the conservatives firmly took over.PAS is now back to its original form – a Malay conservative party that champions Malay unity. That was why it was founded, and it was exactly what Umno’s first president Datuk Onn wanted it to be."
