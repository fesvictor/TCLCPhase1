silent_stalker,20170503,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 820,201204,,Correct. They are just politicians. Same as those in DAP and BN. The difference is PAS use religion as a tool to gain support for their own personal gain.

eaglehelang,20170503,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 980,201009,,"They go for Amanah, due to disatisfaction with governance post Nik Aziz's era.No Amanah or PH contesting, some will even go for BN, some undi rosak. This is what the Kelantanese tell me lah, you can ask around yourself.In any case, keen contest, not like 'not a single seat in Kelantan' as stated by Nik Aziz son in law. A few of the ADUN and MP already cross over Amanah"

Left the new fresh faces, mostly. Once again, this is as according to Kelantanese still residing in Kelantan."

I have family members in Kelantan, and from my last visit, I do notice that (at least in case of my family), people are starting to doubt the current PAS's governance. I do somehow hope that it goes to Amanah, because then, we have a higher chance to experience new government."
