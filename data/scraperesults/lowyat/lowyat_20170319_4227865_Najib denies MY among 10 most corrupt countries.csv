I will ensure Malaysia continues to succeed and remained peaceful while the people continue to have the opportunity to find a living in this country.""To achieve this objective, it is important for me to remind everyone about matters which could destroy our own nation,"" he said in the latest entry in his blog najibrazak.com last night.Reminding the nation of the Lahad Datu incident, he said the country lost many patriots following the irresponsible actions of some quarters.""We can still remember the incident in Lahad Datu where security forces personnel were sacrified because there were covert enemies. At that time, the intruders had obtained prior information on the movements of our security forces and ambushed our soldiers in a house,"" he said.Recently, he said the people almost became victims due to the irresponsible actions of some acting to frustrate the country and nearly caused the loss of an investment by Saudi Arabia following the spread of slanders on the country's economy which was apparently going to go bankrupt and that it could not afford to pay the salaries of civil servants.""This is completely not true. Thank God, after showing the actual performance of the country's economy, Saudi Arabia agreed to invest RM31 billion in Malaysia through the petroleum company Aramco,"" he said.He said Malaysians would suffer losses if these irresponsible parties succeeded in their slanders.Following the slander, Najib said the people would definitely be denied the employment opportunities of high income as well as opportunities from the supporting sectors from the Saudi Arabia investment.At the same time, he was perplexed by a former national leader who was running down the country with news that were not true at all.Corruption claims ‘a lie’""According to him, Malaysia is among the 10 most corrupt countries in the world. This is certainly not true. We are actually at the 55th spot out of 176 countries in the 2016 Corruption Perception Index and there is room for improvement.""But to lie, spread slanders and undermine one's own country, I ask where is the love of this national leader for the country?"" Najib questioned.As a leader, he considered such matters as challenges and reminders to build the nation.""Nonetheless, we as the citizens of Malaysia should continue to find the way forward. In facing the challenges, we also witnessed the real potential of Malaysia when the people are united,"" he said.Taking the example of the badminton event in Rio, he said the country almost clinched the Olympic gold while our footballer Faiz Subri succeeded in winning the FIFA Puskas award based on the spirit of the country and support of the people.""The MH370 and MH17 crises have shown how strong Malaysia is when the people were united as one and Insya-Allah, the diplomatic relations crisis with North Korea would be resolved,"" he said.Apart from that, he said all Malaysians are the country's patriots despite not being in the battlefield.""We are patriots if we conscientiously carry out duties as civil servants,"" he added.He said teachers are patriots if they teach the children with dedication, parents are patriots if they ensure their children grow up as useful human beings while the people should continue to show their love for the country.To build a nation, he said the people should stay united and the love for the nation should be continuously fostered with patriotism throughout the year and not just in the month of August.- Bernama"
