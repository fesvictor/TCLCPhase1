The way PAS is doing it is not right, that’s why we are against it. I have got reasons why I won’t vote,” Mohd Ariff explained.DAP’s parliamentary whip Anthony Loke said the rest of the party’s non-Muslim MPs will vote against the Bill when the time comes.“All of our 36 MPs will oppose the Bill. We will give an explanation why we don’t agree during the debate. We will appoint two MPs to represent us,” the Kluang MP said.The DAP is the largest Opposition party in the Dewan Rakyat and has repeatedly said it is opposed to the Bill which it deems unconstitutional because it sharpens separate punishments for Muslims and non-Muslims.The Bill aims to raise the Shariah courts’ maximum sentencing limits to 30 years’ jail, RM100,000 fine and 100 strokes of the cane. The current limits are three years’ jail, RM5,000 fine and six strokes.The Bill was first passed for tabling in the Dewan Rakyat last year but debate has been delayed since.Recently, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi was reported saying that the government will take over Hadi’s private member’s Bill.However, the non-Muslim component parties in the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition insist they have not agreed to the move.Hadi was also reported saying PAS has no qualms about BN taking over the Bill, but would like to look at the draft first."
