Newsray,20170425,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 199,201112,,"Typo is 1 thing. It is far typo.Pertadbalan (if my malay still correct, i left school 10 years ago)PerbatalanLooking at both words, this is not typo.I would say more of failing to read and pronounce the word.Both word sound the same. Probably the guy doing the job got the contents verbally and he go no clue what the meaning. Heck he dont even know what batal means. So he trying to pronounce and type it wrongly.But batal is serious and it missed all the stages.Design / the one did it totally fail malaySubmission to print / nobody check the contentReceive for printing / worker take and print blindlyReceive the banner / heck nobody see it if quality good or notDisplay banner / missed by everyone else.I think the root cause of poor malay command.Dont know why chinese weak in malay.Last time if i remember correctly, i read less than 10 malay novels, the thick one.Maybe frequent reading of newspaper help.I can speak malay fluently / no problem ucapan Speak english fluently / not perfect but okSpeak cantoneseMandarin poor like shit. Cant order food without sounds like a fool.So if order food and hawker cant speak cantonese, english. Then i need speak malay lor."
