The ADUN is mostly lazy and do not have assistance from the federal government. Better vote for UMNO for ADUN seat. At least you could get something out of them.On the other hand, for parliamentary seat, vote for opposition. We need to see some changes, better or worse."

I think he is winnable candidate for amanah.Btw, i think this statement should not come out from DAP. DAP has no interest in Kelantan at all. So they should keep quiet and let Amanah or Bersatu make this statement instead. Why sound the war drum when you're not coming to conquer the state."

blanket84,20170201,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 541,200805,,And Pakatan should stop fielding ex umno members in Kelantan (i.e: PKR). They rather vote for real umno then fake umno. It's either UMNO or Amanah in Kelantan.

That's why they been supporting PAS for the past 27 years. So loyal even after flood, underdevelopment, lack of jobs, mistreatment of org asli, the poorest state in Merehsia, lack of management from state gomen, they still vote."
