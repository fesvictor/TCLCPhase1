But AFAIK, many other country leader respect Tun Mahathir.I think Malaysia become famous (in good sense) that time also because under Tun Mahathir rules.He also initiated various project like KLIA, KLCC, MSC, Proton, Putrajaya, Cyberjaya, Labuan, Twin Tower, KL Tower.I think he is the one who bring Malaysia to world eye.That time also a lot people very patriotic (during national/independence day), at least you can see bendera Malaysia berkibar everywhere.But how come a lot ppl hate Tun Mahathir??? I dun understand. Ppl of my same age (lates 80s and early 90s) also no understand.Or all the while I (or at least my generation) like  North Korea citizen syok sendiri?Hope unker/auntie in /k can give some feedback."

red streak,20170723,Doto 2 Pinoy Slayer,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 968,200602,,"You think nobody else ever songlapped™? The upper echelons have all done it. It's pretty much an open secret that they all do it but they won't open that can of worms by exposing each other because that would cause huge issues for all of them. It's literally the last thing they'd want to do because once one guy exposes the others for political gain, it means all bets are off. They all have ""guns"" pointed at each other. The only reason why Jibby's songlap was exposed was because he was stupid and careless. His rivals didn't expose him, he did himself by using a retard like Jlow who flamboyantly flaunted all the ill-gotten gains and caught the attention of the DOJ."

LamboSama,20170723,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,201108,,Depends from point of view. If Najib stayed another few decades.Then got more and more projects.Once he retire people sees only the projects he will be considered the same.Just like how people use to bash pak lah.Now he seems like a saint.
LamboSama,20170723,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,201108,,That's exactly it. People want clever leader because they can hide songlap better.
silent_stalker,20170723,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 820,201204,,"I think that is tinfoil hat material. Yes, many politicians songlap. Some use this information to control the other instead of reporting it. But when that person goes against those with information, the trump card will be used to discredit or remove the person. Thats how it always been. Mahathir had used this method many times in the past. Thats y during mahathir time I cant deny there has been alot of songlap happen. Mahathir just close 1 eye. But if they fuckup, mahathir will use it to remove that person. Thats y many hates him since they have nothing on mahathir but mahathir know alot about them. I believe if najib have anything on mahathir now, he would use it without having a second thought."

red streak,20170723,Doto 2 Pinoy Slayer,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 968,200602,,"Is it though? I've never heard of a single incident where a big shark was pulled down for songlap by his peers. All the ones that were charged with corruption were middling officials at best. Nobody at the Minister level has ever been successfully prosecuted for corruption. Even Anwar was discredited for being gay, and not corruption, by Mamakthir and now Jibby. Mamakthir didn't even have to do anything to discredit Jibby, he exposed it himself by using a stupid intermediary. Mamakthir and his Macais just piled onto the hype without having to do anything."

My guess would be they were given the option to step down or face being charged.Muhammad taib, abu hassan, musa hitam, gaafar baba just to name a few. These people willingly step down n keep quite. But anwar he fought back, see what happen to him.Thats how mahathir works."
