I did not communicate with him. I don't know if what he raised also involved the Affin Bank transactions or not.""We have to share notes. I have to go meet him. But I think that our sources are different.""I can't say who, but it's (likely) different,"" said Husam at a press conference today.The Genting affairAfter the Selising ceramah, Husam faced a flurry of threats to sue him for defamation by PAS leaders but none appear to have materialised.Meanwhile, Husam denied allegations that he received funds from Genting Group and threatened to sue former Bandar Tun Razak Umno division secretary Zaharin Mohd Yasin for defamation.He said a letter of demand for an apology and retraction has been served on Zaharin, whp was given one week to respond, failing which a defamation suit would be initiated.""The allegation is untrue. I have never met people from Genting nor (Genting founder) Lim Goh Tong, either in my own capacity or when I was with PAS,"" he said.Zaharin, in a post on Facebook on April 10, claimed that Husam had received money from Genting's non-gaming related industries that was meant for PAS.He claimed that Lim had allegedly felt indebted to PAS for being allowed to build a bridge in Kota Baru and for being given a 'Datuk' title from Kelantan.Zaharin, who used to blog under the handle Sang Kelambai, has a sizeable following online."
