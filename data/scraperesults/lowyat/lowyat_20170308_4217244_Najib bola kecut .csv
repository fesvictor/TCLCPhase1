Perlu juga Korea Utara sedar bahawa Malaysia adalah anggota FPDA (Perjanjian Pertahanan Lima Negara) terdiri dari Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Singapura dan Malaysia yg akan mengambil tindakan segera sekiranya salah sebuah negara tersebut diserang. Perjanjian tersebut telahpun ditandatangani pada tahun 1957 sewaktu Perjanjian Pertahanan Tanah Melayu dan British. Kita percaya Kerajaan Malaysia telah mengambil pertimbangan yg sewajarnya sebelum melaksanakan sesuatu keputusan diplomatik. Berdoa supaya keadaan akan pulih seperti sediakala sepenuhnya dan dengan segera.."

runemastertan,20170308,Regular,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,216",200709,,"if I am looking for a peaceful solution, I wouldn't be fighting fire with fire. That is called provoking. Also, in this world, there are things called big fish eat small fish. Unless you think malaysia is a big fish and NK is a small fish, go ahead, provoke them.and since you asked me, if it is up to me, i will not be banning their people from leaving, and asked for help from other country, such as China.You can always say we are a small country, but don;t look down on the our war capability. It is not about war capability, it is about the damage inflicted on the country once the war broke out. Going for peaceful solution rather than provoking will be my choice.So genius, what would you do? Same as jibby, lock the those NK people in malaysia? NK is a communist country, those 1000 people's life are nothing, NK expect them to die for their country. 1000 NKoreans? Even if there are 2000 NKoreans, NK will still attack Malaysia if they cannot stand the provocation."
