In seasonally adjusted terms, exports rose 2.4%It said the December exports were mainly driven by an increase in E&E products, which grew 9% to RM27bil.Refined petroleum products, which accounted for 6.5% of total exports, expanded RM2bil or 71.9% to RM4.9bil mainly due to the increase in export volume and small contribution from average unit value.Palm oil and palm-based products, which formed 8.5% of total exports, recorded an increase of RM1.3bil to RM6.4bil.Exports of palm oil, the major commodity in this group of products rose RM452.8mil or 14.1% due to the increase in average unit value as export volume decreased.In addition, crude petroleum, which contributed 3.3% to total exports, grew 15.9% to RM2.5bil mainly due to the increase in average unit value and small contribution from export volume.Read more and credit: http://www.thestar.com.my/business/busines...il-in-december/"
