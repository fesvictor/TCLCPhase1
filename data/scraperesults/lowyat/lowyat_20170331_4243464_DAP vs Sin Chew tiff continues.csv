Established in 1929, Sin Chew Daily has always made upholding the country's diversity one of its objectives. For the past 88 years, we have been serving the Malaysian Chinese community and fearlessly voicing up for it, because we won't get this far today without the support of the Chinese community.On Sunday, Sin Chew Daily deputy executive editor-in-chief Tay Tian Yan penned down his expectations for DAP, expressing in a sentimental way how he went from supporting the party to feeling totally disenchanted by it. While the words were a depiction of his personal feelings, they nevertheless also reflected how many others felt.Unfortunately, Tay's article was reciprocated with a letter from DAP secretary-general's office titled DAP has never let anyone down! in an attempt to demonize Tay and Sin Chew Daily, as how the party would normally do to its rivals.While we welcome the letter from DAP secretary-general's office to have a rational communication with us, we do hope that it will continue to adopt a more magnanimous and open-minded attitude instead of resorting to dirty smearing tactics and making baseless allegations that the local Chinese language media are ""morally depraved"" for being manipulated by Barisan Nasional. Such defamatory and slanderous accusations will not only demonize Sin Chew Daily, but have also denied all the efforts and hard work we have put in over the past 88 years in serving the local Chinese community. It is a great pity that DAP has opted to shut the door of rational communication behind it.All this while we have been performing our duties in answering to our fellow Chinese Malaysians. We have our roots planted in the local Chinese community, and have thrived on its undivided support. We absolutely believe that millions of online and offline readers know how to choose wisely. We are one with the Chinese community and have always prioritized their interests at different stages in history and at times of turbulence. We will never compromise on the journalistic ethics we have been championing all these years, nor allow ourselves to be paralyzed by any form of political intervention, as we carry out our supervisory duties in a just and impartial manner.If at any point such a posture of being an important mouthpiece of the local Chinese community as well as the obligation to shape the cultural spirit of Chinese Malaysians get into the way of the agenda of any political party or alliance, it is our sincere hope that this matter will be looked into rationally and in good faith. Repeated oppression and ill-intentioned slanders are never part of the democratic pursuits of our diverse Malaysian society, nor the wish of millions of Chinese Malaysians. Such behaviors will only delight those who embrace ethnic, cultural and religious bigotry.Sin Chew Daily Editorial Desk- See more at: http://www.mysinchew.com/node/117307?tid=4...4.HjWLaFFz.dpuf"

PappyBoyington,20170331,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,It is not a question of supporting Sin Chew or otherwise. It's a question of whether it is right for DAP to use intimidation on a media outlet (the 4th estate).  Are you familiar with the issue?

If he's still one of the owners, then criticisms that the paper is biased towards the ruling government is not completely unfounded.Also, I wonder where some of you guys were when Malaysiakini was harrassed by the government or when the Edge and the Malaysian Insider were both banned by the government. Oh wait. Some of you guys were there, defending the government's actions."
