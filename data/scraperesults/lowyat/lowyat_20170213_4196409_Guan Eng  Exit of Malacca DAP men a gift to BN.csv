But today I make this decision without heartache,"" he said. – BernamaThere could be more, there usually is."

When BN people quit because they disagree with the direction, you welcome their decision (for having principles or otherwise).  When your own pipur quit when they disagree with you, you call them traitorsit sounds like DAP's top echelon is stuck in an echo chamber."
joe_mamak,20170213,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,I don't understand what you wrote.  I am saying I would just go quietly.  What has free speech got to do with it?  I exercise my right to not to speak.  That is also one of the freedoms we all enjoy.
