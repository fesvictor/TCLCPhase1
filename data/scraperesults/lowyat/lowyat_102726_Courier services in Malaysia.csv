Nil Einne,"  Jul 16 2005, 02:58 PM",Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 291,Joined: Jan 2003,,"nerd- The cheapest service would probably be PosLaju. Will probably be 2-4 days Alternatively, if you don't need a speedy service, it will probably be even cheaper if you use registered (Pos Daftar) airmail, will probably take about a week.However bear in mind that it may be illegal or at the very least against the terms of subscription with you telco (Telstra or whatever) and/or ISP to connect an ADSL router from overseas (which will be uncertified). Also bear in mind that it is possible that connecting such an uncertified device may result in problems with your insurance if your house burns down even if the device is not the cause of the fire.Also you might want to look into tax issues. I'm pretty sure Aussie has not import tax on computer items but GST will apply. Therefore it will be up to the customs official whether to charge you GST, they may have a policy normally applied to such situations which you may be able to find out from their website. For example, in NZ the policy is that customs duties (including GST) will not be charged if the total amount owing is under $50 for an item imported for personal use which means you can import an item of $400 or less if only GST is to be charged (GST is 12.5% here). Generally this amount will include postage/shipping costs. However bear in mind that such policies are probably not legally binding by which I mean the customs officials could probably still charge whatever the amount owing and you will have no legal recourse other then to pay it. This is probably unlikely but you might want to check and find out. A good place to ask may be OCAU (overclockers.com.au) since there are frequently people who buy stuff from the US etc.Of course, your friend could under declare the item but bear in mind that such a thing would definitely be illegal and in general the customs officials reserve the right to indepedently determine the cost of an item. Also, obviously if you under declare an item, any insurance will only be applied to the under declared value.Personally, I suspect customs duties will not be a problem unless your planning to buy a very expensive wifi ADSL router but I would avoid using anything imported which connects to the phoneline except as a backup device. The potential headaches and problems you may get from various people and companies for using a uncertified device is too much of a hassle to be worth it IMHO."

My telco is TPG and I'm given a choice of whether to purchase the ADSL router from TPG or use my own equipment. It did not state any verification issues as long as the router I supplied myself meets certain specifications. So I think getting a router from Malaysia wouldn't be a problem. As for the tax issue, do you mean the customs will impose tax on the router even though it's wrapped and declared as another item? Do the customs check what is in the package?"

I also want to send something overseas last time, and I tried all famous couriers I know, Fedex, DHL, NationWide Express, TNT, UPS, but they are very expensive. I think for ur 30KG, NationWide will charge you around 700+. So the cheapest courier should be PosLaju.   If you can find cheaper ones, pls let me know!   BTW, what are u sending? 30KG!"
