She holds a Master of Business Administration and is currently pursuing a PhD in management on a part-time basis.Lee, who is single, said she hoped to secure enough votes from the younger voters to create an upset in Bukit Kepayang, which was won by DAP’s Cha Kee Chin with a 9,457- majority over the Gerakan candidate in the last general election.Bukit Kepayang, a Chinese-majority state seat in Seremban, has been held by the DAP the past two terms.“I am aware that Bukit Kepayang is a super black area for Barisan Nasional,” she said, adding that she would work towards helping youths become entrepreneurs and correcting the many misconceptions about the Government.Choong described Lee as “young and aggressive”.He said that the state Gerakan decided to make an early announcement of Lee as the candidate “as the general election can be called anytime from now.”Her appointment had also been endorsed by party president Datuk Seri Mah Siew Keong, he added.Choong also said the party had initially shortlisted six candidates for the seat.“We picked Lee as she has come up with an impressive plan and strategies to win the seat,” he said, praising Lee as a good public speaker and management consultant.In Negri Sembilan, Gerakan traditionally contests the Bukit Kepayang and Senawang state seats.Asked about the candidate for Senawang, Choong said this had yet to be finalised.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...SyaGq4RwgJMq.99"
