Racial base party will only further devide our society.Bersih is just a publicity stun, reformation should starts from the political party itself and a formation of new party or alliance between parties is never a solution. Political alliance is bound to fail and it will only weaken the country unity.Truth is all our politicians is fighting for their own personal gain only, everybody tries to have a piece of the cake."
