Tanpa aduan itu, tidak akan ada penyiasatan ke atas 1MDB oleh DOJ.""Malah pada ketika itu dan sehingga hari ini tiada sesiapa daripada 1MDB telah dipanggil oleh DOJ untuk memberikan keterangan, bukti atau disoal. Ini jelas menunjukkan DOJ tidak mempunyai kes terhadap 1MDB,"" kata Vell Paari lagi.Mengulas lanjut, Fahariyah berkata, individu yang membuat laporan kepada DOJberkaitan 1MDB sebenarnya seorang penghasut yang mempunyai niat jahat untuk menganggu-gugat pentadbiran negara.“Bagi saya ini adalah sikap terdesak pihak tertentu yang amat desperado bagi merosakkan imej kepimpinan negara.“Mereka sudah tidak ada isu maka isu lama dikitar semula untuk mengalih perhatian rakyat,” ujarnya lagi.Reputasi DOJ sebenarnya semakin terjejas dan menjadi bahan jenaka di persada dunia kerana dakwaan tidak berasaskan fakta dan tidak dibuktikan di mahkamah terlebih dahulu, tambahnya."

hackwire,20170620,Look at all my stars!!,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 4,180",200501,,"Sunday, 19 February 2017Behind the scenes to front row politicsby shahanaaz habibFahariyah: ‘When you are in politics, you hold power and when you hold power, then you are able to help the people.’Fahariyah: ‘When you are in politics, you hold power and when you hold power, then you are able to help the people.’MOST politicians love the spotlight and being in the news. For them, talking about themselves seem to come naturally. But it is quite the opposite with Datuk Fahariyah Md Nordin of Puteri Umno.Despite having been in politics for 16 years, the 38-year-old, who was appointed senator in December, comes across as a shy and very private person, especially when it comes to opening up about herself.‘“I am not an interesting person! ‘’ she says somewhat apologetically.“I am so low profile that when people ask me about my personal life, I don’t know how to answer,” she confesses.Such honesty is refreshing in this cynical world of politics.Johor-born Fahariyah, who has a masters degree in Human Development, says many people have asked about her low key image.“I have been in Puteri for 16 years. I’ve worked as a research officer with the (former) Johor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Ghani Othman’s office. I was private secretary to the Miti deputy minister Datuk Hamim Samsuri. I was one of (Datuk Seri) Azalina (Othman)’s officers, so by right, politically I am supposed to be ‘famous’ but I am not.“I guess that is because I am more of a worker. It’s not that publicity is not important in politics. It is. But to me, it is good enough for my bosses to have the publicity, not me. But now that I am a senator, I need to step up.”Third among six siblings – and from a family of non-politicians – Fahariyah got into politics at the age of 22 by being at the right place at the right time.She was working at the Johor Mentri Besar’s office when Puteri Umno was being set up and Ghani picked her as the protem Puteri head for Johor.The plan was for her to help set up Puteri in Johor then go off to further her studies.‘‘But like (what) people say ... ‘Once you are in politics, you cannot get away’. As you can see, I am still here. I don’t see politics as being all about power, politicking and backstabbing.“For me, it as a platform to help others. When you are in politics, you hold power and when you hold power, then you are able to help the people.’’"
