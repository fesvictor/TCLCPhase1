Zhan! Zhan! (Fight! Fight! Fight!)”MCA president Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai, referred to as the “commander in chief” by the master of ceremonies, presented the Barisan Nasional flags to state party representatives, signalling the start of the preparation works for GE14.The pledge taking ceremony was held during celebrations to mark the third anniversary of the relaunch of the MCA School of Political Studies.“Victory is ours when we unite. MCA is strong and prosperous!” Liow pledged.As the delegates belted out the patriotic song Inilah Barisan Kita, renowned local martial arts master Siow Ho Phiew continued to hit the drums, hyping up the atmosphere with his forceful, rhythmic beats.Speaking to reporters later, Liow said the party wanted grassroots leaders to do their best at GE14.“MCA has many strong points. We champion economic development and welfare for the people.“For instance, we set up the Tunku Abdul Rahman College University, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman and VTAR Institute, and are pushing for Malaysia’s participation in China’s Belt and Road initiative.“These messages have to be effectively relayed to the Chinese community by grassroots leaders. MCA and the Chinese community will be stronger together,” he said.Kuantan Wanita chief Tee Choon Ser said the reactivation of the school was vital in refreshing veteran members’ knowledge and instilling confidence in members.Terengganu Beliawanis MCA chief Wong Miew Kee, 29, observed that the members were more enthusiastic now in attending party activities, such as the “GE14, We’re ready” camps organised by the school in the respective divisions.“We feel the members are more receptive towards the party now.”Temerloh MCA Youth vice-chairman Wong Peng Shen, 29, said he hoped to attend courses on current affairs and political development to better understand the local political landscape.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...bi31L6xVQ3Vu.99"

clydefrog,20170709,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 22,201302,,MCA is only good for making money for the elites. They agreed to accept Chinese being second class citizens in exchange for their leaders being allowed to dominate the economy. Rubbish people in a rubbish party.
