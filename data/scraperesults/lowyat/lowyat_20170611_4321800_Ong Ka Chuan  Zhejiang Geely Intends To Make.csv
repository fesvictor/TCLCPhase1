It will be done in stages. They are now in the process of relocating its operations. They will start building the plant next year,"" he said.Geely currently has 16 manufacturing plants, seven design studios, and five research and development centres across the globe.In May, DRB-Hicom Bhd announced it was selling a 49.9% stake in loss-making Proton to the China-based automaker.As part of the deal, Geely would also buy the entire stake in Lotus from Proton.Proton has a ready capacity in its plant in Tanjung Malim, which produces 150,000 cars annually and designed to have a maximum capacity of one million units per year.DRB-Hicom and Geely are expected to finalise the deal in July.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...jVGKJHv4cTrX.99"
