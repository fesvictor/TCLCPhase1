Itulah sebab saya terlibat secara langsung untuk buat sesuatu.""Saya tidak boleh mengabaikannya. Saya sedang menyaksikan pelbagai salah laku dan ramai orang telah meminta saya untuk melakukan sesuatu,"" kata beliau semasa sesi secara langsung di laman Facebooknya.Sebelum ini, Ahli Parlimen PAS Nik Abduh Nik Aziz merupakan antara mereka yang menggesa Mahathir agar bertaubat.Sambil menggesa Mahathir supaya kembali ke tikar sejadah kerana ia jalan terbaik untuk dirinya di hujung hayat, kata Nik Abduh: ""Tak payahlah buat kerja lu langsi lu mati yang berulang-ulang sejak muda sampai tua.”“Angkat Musa Hitam, pecat Musa Hitam. Angkat Ghafar Baba, pecat Ghafar Baba. Angkat Anwar, pecat Anwar. Angkat Pak Lah, pecat Pak Lah. Angkat Najib, ni nak pecat Najib pulak.""Saya nasihatkan dia jangan pulak angkat Mukhriz. Nanti Mukhriz pun dipecatnya. Rakyat Malaysia pun, saya nak nasihat baik-baik,"" katanya.Nik Abduh berkata demikian ketika mengulas kenyataan Mahathir mengenai allahyarham bapanya dan Mursyidul Am PAS Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat.Semasa sesi Facebook, Mahathir yang kini merupakan Pengerusi Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (BERSATU) menggesa para belia agar mengikuti perkembangan semasa supaya tidak mewarisi negara yang musnah.""Anak muda akan mewarisi negara ini. Sudah tentu tidak ingin mewarisi sebuah negara yang hancur lebur, rosak kerana perbuatan di waktu ini.""Sebab itu, anak-anak muda perlu mengikuti perkembangan dalam negara- politik, ekonomi, sosial supaya sebelum negara dirosakkan, tahu apa yang harus dilakukan dan mereka tentukan bahawa perosak-perosak ini tidak akan dapat teruskan usaha merosakkan setelah pilihan raya umum,"" tambah beliau."

FYI, when this old fucker makes a sound, people condemn him because he DESERVES to be condemn. To me this man deserves to be tried to be TREASON for all the shit he has done to this country. Just so you understand when I say Mahathir should be tried for treason, that does not mean he is the only one - since you seem to have difficulty grasping the concept of statement limitation. Just because there are people who are macais and seemed taksub to certain person or political group does not mean everybody is a macai that can't think."

scorptim,20170602,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 378,200911,,"Look, I get what you are saying but here's the reality, there's ""what's right"" and then there's ""politics"". In an ideal world, both of these should go hand in hand but in reality, it never happens...regardless of which country you go to. You wanna compare Mahathir to Osama? Name me 1 good thing Osama did or achieved first. Mahathir has done a lot of shit and damage to the country, that is agreed, but at the same time he's done quite a lot of good things for the country too? Should he be tried for treason? Yes, I think he should, but now is not the time. It's the time for politics and ensuring that najib/BN is brought down. That's the main focus right now and everyone should remember this. He started cronyism in Malaysia? Well perhaps he did or more accurately he is the one who really made cronyism flourish in Malaysia. Even before his time cronyism was already around but he did take it to a new level and now najib is pushing that extreme even further. Now let's look at the impact of his cronyism, during his time...how bad was the impact to an average Malaysian. The sugar king monopolized all the sugar, but what's the price of sugar again back then? And didn't it pretty much stay around the same price over the years with just slight increases in price? In fact, it was cheaper than most our neighbouring countries. So...yes there was a monopoly going on but did it bring more harm to the average Malaysian? In a way, it kinda kept the price controlled didn't it? It was pretty much the same scenarios for other necessities. Other cronies who controls services and other non essential things did charge rather high prices for their products etc but then again, these are not necessities. Even house prices...when countries like Singapore and other countries were already skyrocketing in the 90s, Malaysia still pretty much maintained affordable house prices during his time.The point is he has done a lot of bad deeds, but he pretty much ensures that the songlapping, cronyism etc would not burden the normal folks much as prices of necessities are kept in check. The average Malaysian could easily afford all the necessities and even own houses easily even with a low pay. Of course if you want extra things or luxuries, then you'd have to pay through your nose. That's why back during his time BN always had 2/3 majority. Because most of the common folks didn't mind those things as life was good regardless of the songlap and cronyism. Only a fraction of upper middle class and rich people was strongly against him, not because they care about the country but because his crony policies are stopping their own wealth and business growth. But let's look at what's happening right now? Everyone is affected by what najib is doing. Prices of essential goods are going up and housing...you see for yourself la. Rather than wasting time condemning an old guy who's gonna die anytime soon for what he did before. Isn't it better to spend that time to tackle the current issue? And at the same time squeeze out any ounce of power left in the old man to overthrow najib?Once that is done, you can place him in front of a firing squad and shoot him, hang him, tie him up to four horses and let them split his body into pieces for all I care. But the reality is that right now, we need him for any chance of overthrowing the current govt. Even then chances are low but if you just placing your bets on DAP, pkr, pan... You simply won't have enough votes. That's the reality of it. Only this old man has the ability to steal votes from bn/umno strongholds which has always been the cause why opposition loses. There is another option if you don't want to do the above... Which is change needs to happen outside of elections. Proper protests and forcefully remove style...and no, I don't mean like how we did the half day weekend Bersih picnic. I mean real protests, it can be peaceful but definitely won't be just for half a day on a weekend. But how many Malaysians willing to do this? Heck if condemning mahathir can change the govt, then by all means go ahead and put all efforts into that, but it doesn't change a thing in our current situation does it?"

RobUlstan,20170602,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 89,201012,,"If the people who support Mahathir now's only concern is that SG1 = RM3 so that the imported stuff are now more expensive for them or that price of petrol > RM2.4 so they have to pay extra for their cars or sugar and other stuff are more expensive for them to buy and can forgive and forget how this man systematically destroyed various institutions of the nation, bred cronyism and corruption at all levels of government which has become endemic until almost Indonesian level, misused our laws to detain political rivals and 'allegedly' did Project IC that sold the country to foreigners for political power, then I have no wish to be in this group.If this is the reason for supporting him, then if the economy under Najib were better and prices were lower, this group would live happily again and support Najib without question too I guess, turning a blind eye to the songlaping and cronyism like normal. A country deserves the government it gets, and if this is the mentality of the people than I think I know why we are in such deep shit.You think condemning him does not change a thing, I think supporting him also does not change a thing. Many people (who are not macais) moved away from the opposition when they started working with him also."
scorptim,20170602,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 378,200911,,"Like I said, . . ideals versus reality mate. The reality is that every living being would always prioritize themselves and their own well being. There is a minority who would always subscribe to ideals and won't budge and inch but the majority doesn't subscribe to the same belief. You need the majority support for something to change. That's reality. You want people to support you, you need to cater to their needs and wants. That's also reality. Even the opposition reformasi movement started when Anwar got jailed, why do you think he only opposed the govt after he was jailed? Before that he was also happily songlapping in BN. It's all for the same reason, personal benefit. Most people knows this but they choose to support him because ultimately they also want better personal benefits for themselves."

Kopitiam",Group: Elite,"Posts: 1,659",200702,From: KL,"To me its all expendiency. If it helps the agenda, everyones a friend; if theyre not useful, then even the smallest issue will cause a rupture. If you consider mahathirs obj is to set up his son, then pakatan is a vehicle for him to achieve that. Pakatan accepts him because they see that they could draw on some of his supporters - but whether it is enough to overcome the deficit of pas leaving is another matter.If mahathir really had to resort to working with his former rivals - with a 'junior' position - it implies that najib has a strong grip on bn, cutting off mahathirs ability to navigate intraparty politics. If we accept that premise, then the assumption that mahathir could wrestle away some of the bn votes may be too optimistic. Same can be said of pas' offshoot: pan. They would also be unlikely to wrestle much votes from pas, at least to cover what is lost. Both bersatu and pan will kinda cannibalise pakatan's existing voter base - pkr and dap will need to consider which seats they allocate to these two parties.Pas will likely be a kingmaker here, which i think is their startegy for this election. As long as they have sufficient seats, both sides will come back to woo them. Now if bn lost, najib will be booted out. I just have a suspicion that if that happens, parti bersatu will eventually quit pakatan, rejoin bn, and be reabsorbed by umno with mahathir, mulhriz and muhyiddin resuming their old connections and leadership roles within the old party. Just a thought."

tokdukun,20170602,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 259,200611,,"Well said, though we were blessed in 90s as among the rising Asian tigers. That's why can afford to give ""freebies"" back to rakyat, with the low cost of living back then. Once the musical chair stops with 97 crisis, we were caught with our pants down and screwed up as we are until today. I'm not really defending Najib, but i can understand some of the hard decisions he took, cuz even if assuming he can contain corruption to minimum and his resource management skills >9000 to manage wealth, investment, returns etc, it probably won't be enough and we have to begin to adapt to market forces. The reality is he's nowhere that skilled, hence the situation is worse than it could be.The onus is not just on govt to recover, but our people too as a whole that is currently plagued with entitlement/tongkat mentality. People now too obsessed with enriching ownself at the expense of others, instead of innovating and creating value that will improve our competitiveness. Eg South Korea after the 97 crisis went on to innovate and become valuable thanks to their chaebols like Samsung, LG, Hyundai/Kia. We have too few of that, eg Top Glove, AirAsia to help uplift the nation's economy. Drb is the epitome of success by tongkat, nearly every of their venture is by virtue of monopoly/protection by license to do business literally impossible to rugi, at the expense of lousy quality of service. Proton have been like headless chicken throughout their ownership, a stark contrast to DSZ management era, their incompetence in managing proton costed their entire group profit to plunge into losses. Honda while having good product, I've heard enough of its sub-par assembly quality and aftersales, Mitsu, Jeep, Audi so irrelevant, Puspakom, bernas, etc monopoly. The point is, this is how the nation strive to be, they just wanna have easy success by protection/tongkat, without innovating or creating value. These kinda ""successes"" shouldn't be celebrated nor encouraged, but the society norm relegates them to be role model. Throw them into real competition like proton, they'll just fall apart. They dunno how to compete and earn their keep.As the nation stop innovating and lose competitive drive, we regressed while others reap benefit like South Korea. On political front, i see how rakyat's part on pulling down the nation, too much fragmentation in interest, causing difficulty in uniting and functioning well as a single nation. It's worse when religion is being used to bend people to some party's interest that goes against the benefits of the nation. All logic will just fall apart in the face of ""benefit for the afterlife, for this worldly affair is only temporary"". Najib is just taking advantage bcuz why not, but we can't break out bcuz we can't be united. The single best chance at unity i saw before was when DSAI was in charge, but that too is unpopular to some faction as he's gay la, immoral person la. Adui laaa. See, we just can't put the nation first. It's despairing to see how opposition today like headless chicken without a direction, but the same can be said back to rakyat for not knowing/wanting to care to pull ourselves together to achieve back the greatness we had in 90s."

scorptim,20170602,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 378,200911,,"Well said and agreed on most your points. On the bolded though, I think we must also look at why people choose to sacrifice others to enrich ownself instead of innovating and increasing our competitiveness. One main reason is what najib and his cronies are doing right now. Just look at how many major Malaysian companies were forced to sell their businesses during najib administration, Gardenia, Robert kuok's sugar empire, oldtown just to name a few. People would think 10 times to make their business too big or too successful in Malaysia right now because if they did, they'd be forced to sell it off. Some even moved their bases out of Malaysia the moment they get too big just to avoid this. So in the end, we still need to change govt first. But like you said, people care more about religion and race rather than uniting together for the nation."

tokdukun,20170602,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 259,200611,,"Yep, the one in charge of governance is plagued with tongkat mentality and only care showing off wealth instead of welfare for the nation. If only they were competent and have integrity to do it for the nation, they would make very different decision. Profits/resources should be managed responsibly, it should mostly be reinvested back to economy or businesses to help strengthen their competitive edge, but instead they are mismanaged to bribe this dato, that tan sri, here and there. Hence why they shouldn't be glorified, and changed. But the key ingredient to change is unity, and that is very difficult. Even in this thread can see. By right we should unite, it doesn't matter who DrM was, what matters now is want to change govt first. But some people die2 cannot accept him for what he did in the past. Maybe yes, he actually tak insaf, he got ulterior motive to bring up his son cuz he can't do that with bn. So what? What do we lose? Itupun mau selfish and die2 won't support opposition, hence back to square, forever under bn, no hope whatsoever to break this vicious cycle we're in."
joe_mamak,20170602,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Well, your earlier statement was an overstatement.  Or is it just your usual strawman argument?  Face it, Mahathir joining the opposition does not make him a hero.  Many view it with skepticism, especially when his Bersatu party kept to a race based platform.  How different is it from UMNO?  Yes, most of us long timers know what you are about.  Race above all."
