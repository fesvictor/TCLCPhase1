mcchin,20170105,???,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 3,335",200507,"From: Sin Lor, B'worth,Pg.","1. For a long time it had been the official policy of DAP to not accept awards and decorations from the Rulers because that goes against DAP’s stand of being anti-feudal and anti-monarchy. DAP also issued an official statement that if they needed to observe the dress code when having an audience with a Ruler then they would rather not meet the Ruler. DAP does not mind using western attire but not any attire that is associated with the Malays or Islam even if protocol demands it.so dress code acceptance or reluctance is race?2. In 1990, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah invited DAP and PAS to form an opposition coalition with Semangat 46. DAP said it would agree to join up with Semangat 46 only if PAS was not included in that coalition unless PAS first of all officially announces that it is abandoning the Islamic Sharia laws plus the idea of a theological state and agrees to accept the secular state.Laws is race?3. After the 2013 general election, DAP pushed for the ouster of the Selangor Menteri Besar, Khalid Ibrahim, to be replaced with Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail. HRH the Sultan of Selangor, however, would not accept Wan Azizah and His Highness made that known. His Highness also wanted the names of three candidates and not just one, as DAP and PKR stubbornly insisted. So PAS complied with this royal decree or titah.Race???4. DAP and PKR then challenged the Sultan and accused His Highness of violating the Constitution. DAP and PKR, however, did not explain whether they are talking about the Federal Constitution or the State Constitution and which Article of the Constitution they are talking about. DAP and PKR demonstrated biadap towards the Sultan and taught the people to hate the Sultan (as they did in Perak a few years earlier in 2009).logical talk = race????5. Basically, RUU355 is an amendment to the Sharia laws that were passed by the Kelantan State Assembly 24 years ago in 1993. This was never a problem in 1999 when DAP joined Barisan Alternatif or in 2008 when DAP joined Pakatan Rakyat. Today it is a problem for DAP because they need this as an excuse to punish PAS for not going against the Sultan of Selangor.no comment, too young/naive back then to know6. DAP’s action of using RUU355 as the excuse to break up Pakatan Rakyat and form Pakatan Harapan has triggered Islamophobia in Malaysia. Islam is now perceived as a pariah religion that must be stopped by any and all means because Islam is a dangerous religion that violates civil liberties and human rights. Furthermore, if the non-Muslims do not oppose RUU355, then, once passed, it would affect non-Muslims and non-Muslims would suffer beheading and amputation, says DAP.law of religion = race??plus the kelantan and brunei happenings not exactly give ppl confidencetalk is one thing, but to give examples to go with the points? well DAP not exactly Yuri, brainwashing the ppl  7. DAP’s hate campaign has succeeded and now non-Muslims hate Islam and view Islam as dangerous and a religion that must be eradicated. DAP has damaged race relations and a wave of Islamophobia is sweeping Malaysia. Islam, the Muslims, the Malays and the Rulers are the subject of attacks and Malaysians are no longer scared of saying things about Islam, the Muslims, the Malays and the Rulers, which in the past they would never have done.well when theres action there will be always reactionswe are now way past ruler of absoluteto bad the actions and non-actions made self look badand start to blame other for having a more clearer sight of what is true and what is lies"

Sultan Nizar citing his discretion under Article XVIII (2)(b) of the Perak State Constitution.This is a matter of legal interpretation of the constitution.  If challenging this is deemed, anti-Melayu, anti-Islam dan anti-raja Melayu then we're just blindly allowing absolute power without any tinge of justice. This is DAP's defense.DAP chairman and Bukit Gelugor MP Karpal Singh issued a notice that he will file a lawsuit against the sultan and the new Barisan Nasional state government for acting beyond the state Constitution. Since the Election Commission had ruled that there was doubt over the vacancy of the state seats of Changkat Jering and Behrang (held by Osman Jailu and Jamaluddin Mohd Radzi respectively) after the pre-signed letters submitted by Assembly Speaker V. Sivakumar in relation to their resignation were contradicted by denials from both assemblymen, it triggered the provision of Article 33 (1). The provision stated that ""if any question arises whether a member of the state Legislative Assembly has become disqualified for membership, the decision of the assembly shall be taken and shall be final"".[33] Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin also filed an application at the High Court to declare the swearing in of Zambry Abdul Kadir as unconstitutional and illegal.[34]"

Sultan Nizar citing his discretion under Article XVIII (2)(b) of the Perak State Constitution.This is a matter of legal interpretation of the constitution. If challenging this is deemed, anti-Melayu, anti-Islam dan anti-raja Melayu then we're just blindly allowing absolute power without any tinge of justice. This is DAP's defense.DAP chairman and Bukit Gelugor MP Karpal Singh issued a notice that he will file a lawsuit against the sultan and the new Barisan Nasional state government for acting beyond the state Constitution. Since the Election Commission had ruled that there was doubt over the vacancy of the state seats of Changkat Jering and Behrang (held by Osman Jailu and Jamaluddin Mohd Radzi respectively) after the pre-signed letters submitted by Assembly Speaker V. Sivakumar in relation to their resignation were contradicted by denials from both assemblymen, it triggered the provision of Article 33 (1). The provision stated that ""if any question arises whether a member of the state Legislative Assembly has become disqualified for membership, the decision of the assembly shall be taken and shall be final"".[33] Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin also filed an application at the High Court to declare the swearing in of Zambry Abdul Kadir as unconstitutional and illegal.[34]This is my replySo did Datok Nizar win in the court and became Menteri Besar Again?I guess I forgot to repeat my answer in previous post that DAP has thought people to hate the Sultan Selangor like they did with Sultan Perak which is equal to Anti-Malays Rulers."
