I think much of it has been said publicly,"" she told the press at PKR headquarters, here Friday.PAS, which is no longer part of the Opposition coalition, had insisted that it will only work with PKR in terms of seat distribution.However, this has put PKR in a bind as it is cooperating with DAP and Parti Amanah Negara, the two parties PAS specifically refuses to work with.The situation may get more complicated as newcomer Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM), led by former premier Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, had requested seats from the Opposition.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017..._medium=twitter"
