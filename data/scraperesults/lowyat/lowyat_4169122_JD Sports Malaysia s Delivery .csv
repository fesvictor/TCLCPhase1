Ordered a pair of Triple White NMDs from them; package and everything came on time, however the size that they sent to me was wrong. Gave them a quick call in the UK, told them about the issue, and they told me that they would reserve a pair of the correct size (because technically their fault for getting sending me the wrong size right?). They received my item on Tuesday and they mentioned that they have no records of saving / reserving the size for me, even though I called them about 4 - 5 days ago and the customer size guy over the phone told me that he'll put it down. So now, I'm hoping that I get a refund, cause the shoes plus the shipping cost wasn't cheap, and from reading reviews, some people in the UK got their refund, but those that paid via PayPal did not. (Anyone here with a JDSports UK refund story?)At the same time, my girlfriend was buying a pair as well from JDSports, and her order came on time and in the correct size (albeit the socks that she also ordered with the shoes were in the wrong size, can't be fussed about that, lol)So not too sure what's up with them, I think they need to change their warehouse manager and also their customer service team all together.

I think it was the problem with the snail mail Swedish courier (Direct Link). My friend in singapore bought the exact same shoes from them on the same day but he got it within a week as they used a different courier (DPD UK). To be honest, JDsports UK's staff were quite helpful throughout when i PM them on fb. But yea the status update on their website was trash.My advice is that you can buy from JD sports online only if it's limited release like certain NMD primeknits or ultraboost or even jordans.

IF I'm not mistaken, Nikes either ship from Singapore or Australia. Distance is shorter, and less customs. However, am not too sure if the product itself would ship straight from the US cause it's NikeID. But from what I've heard from friends, it's okay; not as a bad as JD. I think honestly I got really lucky with my shipment with JD Sports; despite having to send it back, they refunded me in due time; and recently they wanted to get my mobile number so that they can refund me the return costs by this week. An advice for everyone I guess, is to just call their customer service line everyday and push them to escalate your case after you've dropped them an email. Call at 4pm; which is UK 9am, and you'll usually be able to get someone on the phone with you. (Also protip, just use office phone to call, hahah)"

I was informed the same by JD.Made my order last week and it just arrived at KLIA. JD mixed up the invoice amount and amount declared on airway. Got held at customs. Spoke to DHL and they ask me to send supporting of the price of the shoe. During the call I checked about customs duty and DHL confirmed I need to pay the duty.A little disaapointed with JD as they confirmed their DHL account is setup to absorb customs duty directly.I sent JD a message on FB and they just said sorry and to claim back from them. Hope I get my shoe this week.

Eventually they admitted that they can't track what happen to my order. So they are processing a refund. Couple of lesson learnt and hope it helps you guys.1) JD doesn't screw up all the time. My first order was smooth. But they don't have the tendency to screw up.2) if they screw up, their customer service responds promptly. You just need to be consistent and push them. I read earlier someone said spam their FB messenger ?3) Will I order again? Only if I can't find the shoe in store hereCheers!"
