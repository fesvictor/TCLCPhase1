Said change sides due Jibby's winning streak vs oppo already fractured eversince Kajang Move.Refer above.He sapot Jibby faction coz he saw Jibby smart pandai taichi even Altantuya case plus 1MDB kenot sink Jibby. Mahathir kena tiaw becoz that ol man still gila kuasa wan, if you belip RPK la. RPK was one of prime bloggers that assist Mahathir cyber campaign vs Pak Lah back in 2005-2007. So even RPK knew that Mahathir is fighting a losing war against Jibby, but mostly saw him change bash oppo due to Kajang Move aftereffects.Hey kenot blame him. So someone offer bigger fish opkos as paid media influencer he sure grab big opportunity la. Kinda like mercenary loyal to paymaster."
