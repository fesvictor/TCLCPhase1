Dr Mahathir ‘s PPBM has only one…so it would be difficult for it to happen,”  he said after launching  Maran UMNO’s Wanita wing’s Delegates Conference here today.Shahidan,  who is also Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department, was commenting on media reports of Dr Mahathir’s admission that he had planned to topple Najib since 2014.Shahidan added that it would be difficult to implement the plan as Najib had strong support not just from UMNO but also from all  BN component parties.Commenting on the three heads in the leadership of Pakatan Harapan (PH), Shahidan said the party was only playing a game with the people as there was no DAP representative in its top leadership.PH made up of opposition parties PPBM, DAP, PKR and Parti Amanah Negara (Amanah) just released its new leadership which sees Dr Mahathir as the chairman, jailed  former opposition leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as the de facto leader and Anwar’s wife  Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail as president.DAP, the strongest party in the alliance, was only given a deputy president post.In PUTRAJAYA, UMNO Supreme Council member  Datuk Ab Aziz Kaprawi echoed the same, adding that Dr Mahathir was just using the 1MDB issue and excuse to “get his way”.In a statement here, the Deputy Transport Minister said Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin who joined Dr Mahathir after being sacked as Deputy Prime Minister and Dr Mahathir’s son Mukhriz, who was dropped as Kedah menteri besar, were all traitors to UMNO as they were all insincere in their struggle. – Bernamahttp://www.theborneopost.com/2017/07/15/di...najib-shahidan/"
