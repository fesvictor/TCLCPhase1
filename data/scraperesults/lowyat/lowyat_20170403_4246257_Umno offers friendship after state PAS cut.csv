We can become friends or partners on Islamic matters,"" he told reporters after closing the Penang Undergraduates Festival at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), here today.The two parties had good relations on Islamic matters and the management of 200 mosques in Penang because mosque-goers were members of PAS and Umno.Zainal said the federal leadership would decide whether Umno and PAS could or could not cooperate on political matters.Yesterday, all 13 PAS divisions in Penang unanimously passed a motion to end political cooperation with PKR in their annual general meetings.Zainal, who is also Penang Federal Action Council chairman, said he was not shocked at the decision, saying it should have been done much earlier.""They (PAS) had worked hard to help DAP and PKR win for two terms, namely, 2008 and 2013 but look at what they get. I pity the PAS members.""PAS should exercise caution in picking political friends so that the same situation will not repeat itself,"" he added. - Bernama"
