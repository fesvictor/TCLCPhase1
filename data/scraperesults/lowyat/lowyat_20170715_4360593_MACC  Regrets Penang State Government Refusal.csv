They should also play their role and show their commitment to fight corruption and abuse of power.""So I feel it's strange… if other states can (sign the IBR), Kelantan and Selangor have also stated their readiness to implement the IBR, only one state is left (which refuses to sign the IBR). It's up to the rakyat to assess this issue,"" he told reporters after attending the MACC's Hari Raya celebrations with the Chinese community of Pulau Ketam here on Friday night.Last Wednesday, the Penang state government said that the principles of its Competency, Accountability and Transparency (CAT) policy, which has been implemented in the state since 2008, is more effective in efforts to eradicate corruption and abuse of power, as opposed to the IBR.That statement was made following Dzulkifli's statement last Monday, which outlined how the three Opposition-led state governments of Penang, Selangor and Kelantan had yet to take the pledge and sign the IBR.Dzulkifli added it is up to the Penang state government as to whether it ""persists in being stubborn"" and not sign the IBR or otherwise, as it is not compulsory to sign the pledge.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...qphhRvIQg0iI.99"

darthboyzzee,20170715,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"Corruption-Free PledgeThe Corruption-Free Pledge (better known as IBR) is a recent initiative introduced by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) as a brainchild of the Chief Commissioner himself, Datuk Dzulkifli Ahmad. The IBR places emphasis on the pledge and oath voluntarily taken by an organisation’s leadership and members in an individual capacity to hold each of them accountable and responsible for carrying out their duties and to hinder them from engaging in any corruption misconduct throughout their tenure.Openness and accountability displayed by the leadership and staff in signing the Corruption-Free Pledge also attest that fighting and combating corruption is not the executive responsibility of MACC per se; on the other hand, it is the collective duty and responsibility of all members of society, particularly those serving in government agencies, to achieve a nation free from all forms of corruption and abuse of power.IBR Implementation1. Pledge by an individual2. Witnessed by MACC3. Taking the oath to never engage in any corruption activities4. Signing the pledge documentSignificance of IBR Implementation1. To serve as warning and reminder to individuals to stay away from corruption;2. Guarantee from the organisation’s leadership to its members, stakeholders and customers to prevent corruption;3. Disclosure of undertaking of individual commitment in combating corruption;4. To serve as assurance that the organisation has taken the necessary steps to prevent corruption.http://www.sprm.gov.my/index.php/en/2017-0...free-pledge-ibr"
