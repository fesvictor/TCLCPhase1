He tries to gain support from opposition parties by playing up racial sentiments.”Ti was responding to Mahathir’s statement, in which the Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia chairman said it was MCA, and not DAP, which asked for a deputy prime minister’s post.Previously, Mahathir had said that DAP had asked for a deputy prime minister’s post, only to correct himself after his initial statement was refuted by DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng.In 2009, MCA deputy secretary-general Loke Yuen Yow had asked Prime Minister Najib Razak to create an additional deputy chief minister’s post and an additional Barisan Nasional deputy chairman’s post to reflect “true power sharing”.At that time Loke said the creation of the additional deputy prime minister’s post would also show that the government acknowledged the role and contribution of the Chinese community to nation building.The deputy prime minister’s post has been filled by an Umno leader since the first cabinet of Malaya was set up in 1955.In the 2008 general election, BN’s poor performance saw the coalition lose a lot of ground to the opposition and also lose four states: Selangor, Penang, Kedah and Perak.MCA and other non-Malay component parties lost nearly half of their parliamentary and state seats.The opposition continued to win greater support from the Chinese in the 2013 general election and MCA had to settle for only seven parliamentary seats.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...-minister-post/"
