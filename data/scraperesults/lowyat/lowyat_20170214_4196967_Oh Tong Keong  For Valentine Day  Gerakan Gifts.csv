Penang, earn huge $’ in Chinese, was presented to Lim Guan Eng, along with a memorandum on issues related to the state.State opposition party Gerakan presented a T-shirt to Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng today, calling it a gesture of “love” in the spirit of Valentine’s Day today.The white T-shirt printed with the words “I ? Penang, earn huge $” in Chinese, was presented along with a memorandum on issues related to the state.“The t-shirt is to tell the chief minister and the state government not be so focused on earning large profits until they forgot about the difficulties faced by Penangites,” Penang Gerakan vice-chairman Oh Tong Keong said in a press conference at Komtar.Lim had previously used the “I love Penang” tagline in a campaign against Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Mansor’s suggestion for the island state to come under Putrajaya’s direct control.The federal territories minister said his suggestion was to help the Malays there because the DAP-led state government purportedly “do not care” about the race group there.“The chief minister says he only responds to ministers so today we come in the spirit of love and also as Penangites because I am born and bred here,” Oh added.He reminded Lim that all Penangites wanted the state government to resolve issues such as illegal hill clearing, floods, traffic congestion, lack of affordable housing and protecting the heritage buildings in the heritage zone.“Penangites don't want just slogans and banners, they want action,” he said.Oh handed over the t-shirt and the 10-point memorandum to Lim through the latter's information officer Zainol Zahar this morning.Among the other issues he raised include the alleged exit of manufacturing companies from Penang, land reclamation that should be reviewed, parking fees on weekends that should be removed and increase in water tariffs.http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...h.NqHaBCiZ.dpuf"
