Protoculture,20170408,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 807,200410,From: MARS BASE,"Apa masalahnya? Dulu PAS - Gerakan gabung dengan UMNO - MIC - MCA tubuhkan Barisan Nasional (BN) pasca 13 Mei 1969 dan mewujudkan Kerajaan Perpaduan, siap ngan Rukun Negara semua pabala.PH takkan baru sekaran nak bising? Takat DAP-PKR-Amanah dapat join PBBM (aka UMNO Team B), PAS dulu lagi penah join dengan Semangat 46 (UMNO Team B dari 1988 - 1990s), PAS pun boleh kamcheng semula dengan PAS splinter parties such as Berjasa & Hamim yang dulunya penah lawan PAS in late 1970s & early 1980s. Last2 Semangat 46 kambus, Hamim mati tanpa kubur, Berjasa tinggal nama je. Yet PAS survived siap tahaluf siyasi tubuhkan Barisan Alternatif dengan DAP-KeAdilan serta later Pakatan Rakyat dengan DAP-PKR.Apa masalahnya? Pray tell? Jika DAP-PKR sanggup jilat ludah balik kerjasama dengan mortal enemy Tun Dr M and hist UMNO Team B aka PBBM, takkan PAS tak boleh pulak jalin kerjasama dengan mortal enemy UMNO? PAS vs UMNO dah lama sebelum DAP PKR lagipun. PAS penah juga kerjasama Kerajaan Perpaduan atleast 1970 - 1978 ..."

Protoculture,20170408,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 807,200410,From: MARS BASE,"PAS losses in urban areas are expected. Because definitely lost Chinese votes. Tapi dekat Malay heartland PAS will perform as expected sebab sokongan padu boh. PAN pun hanya boleh replace PAS kat certain urban area, tapi rural milik PAS.Penyokong PAS sudah puas hati sebab pimpinan PAS dah lunaskan janji bawa usul RUU 355 dibentang di Parlimen. Atleast itu dah setel (walaupun tangguh sekejap) sekarang PAS boleh rapatkan jemaah dan bagi tumpuan untuk cula dan muktamar. Ni lagi nak plan PRU tak lama lagi.Amanah susah besar harubiru. Macam kapal hilang layar. Nak jadi hero ganti PAS tapi kena upstage dengan PAS. Kemudian PH pulak dari hero rakyat kena game dengan BN.Jangan ingat rakyat tak perati. Kali ni orang Melayu pun rata2 bunyi dah lain macam. Dulu /k suka sangat ratib ""asal orang kita ... asal orang kita ..."" sekarang sentimen on the ground dikalangan Melayu pun dah betul2 asal orang kita."

M4A1,20170408,[*#^?SONE?^#],Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,171",200508,,chinese total population is only only 6mil (22.5%)among 6mil minus out those did not register and under 21.confirm ends up able to vote = 3-4mil. (estimate)so 3-4mil is not a huge chunk of voters if spread across 13 state .assume MAX 4mil voters / 13 state = 300k for 1 state .so is chinese voter important? NOnow compare to malay voters...malay population around 15mil.minus out did not register / under 21 ...BUSUK BUSUK pun ada 10mil .DarkAeonso please tell me how is 3-4mil voters important compare to 10-12 miil voters?
Protoculture,20170408,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 807,200410,From: MARS BASE,Bangangnye statement. Semangat 46 mostly ex-UMNO Team B in 1988 later in late 1990s rejoin UMNO. KeAdilan later change to PKR most its Malay leaders ex-UMNO. PBBM is definitely ex-UMNO Team B Madey versyun 2016.Kuat betul weed kau.

In Penang, perak, johor and selangor,capital of s&s.You see at parliament now 34 dap mps right? Thats the most dap can win now, maybe plus 2 or minus 2 like teluk intan and bentong. So 34/222?very low though to forward own ideology.   Klang also maj chinese ..but the worry is marginal seats like Malay maj even pandan and lembah pantai and ampang ,what more semi urban like Hulu langat, sepang etc. you have no idea how these urban malays will vote.id say there's swing to BN by Malays but how much we don't know."

Malays as well as Sabah &sarawakian have and always held the power to make or break the govt. Just like how Malays, S&S made the difference in GE13, they too made the difference back then. At that time even though there were Malays unhappy with the govt, it wasn't large enough to make the opposition win."
