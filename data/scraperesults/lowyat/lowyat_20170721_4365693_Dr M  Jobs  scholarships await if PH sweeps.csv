Coup De Grace,20170721,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,201611,,"Mahathir Mohamad promises restoration of country's economy and financial status if Pakatan Harapan makes it to Putrajaya.GEORGE TOWN: Dr Mahathir Mohamad today promised more scholarships for students and more job opportunities if Pakatan Harapan (PH) sweeps into power in the coming general election.The chairman of the opposition pact said once it gained control of Putrajaya, it would fix the economy and restore its financial status.“Believe us when we say we can do all this, as we have experience in administrating a country. That is why we have formed PH,” Mahathir told a 1,000-strong crowd at the Penang PPBM Hari Raya open house here today.Mahathir said PH wanted to work for the people and help them shoulder their burden, especially when it came to the rising cost of living.He said he knew the ruling government would do anything to win, including blocking opposition candidates from contesting.“But the people should realise that the vote for PH is a vote for themselves as Malaysians, as PH can administer well, redevelop our country and work hard to clear our debts without burdening the rakyat,” Mahathir said.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...eps-into-power/"

Among some of the contentious issues that Malay extremists were unhappy with the Tunku was their perception that he had neglected the status of the Malay language and Malay education. Malay-medium schools by and large were inferior to English-medium schools then. Malay extremists wanted to reverse this situation.Monitoring the issue closely was then Education Minister Rahman Yaakub. Being a shrewd observer of movements in Umno, Rahman could sense the burning desire of Malay language extremists, who form a powerful lobby in Umno, to elevate the status of their language to a level higher than that of English, especially through schools. He decided to take a gamble that fateful day in July or August 1969 - and succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.Out of the blue, Rahman announced the conversion of all English-medium schools to Malay- medium ones beginning from Standard 1 with effect from Jan 1, 1970. Many, including the Malay language extremists, were caught by surprise as the decision was sudden and arbitrary. Still, it could not be challenged by the non-Malays much as they had objected to it, as the country was under emergency rule exercised by the National Operations Council (NOC). -----------Mahathir joined UMNO back in 1972, and was appointed as a Menteri Pelajaran in 1974"

As a result, new imported cars in the country are averagely 11-46% higher than in Thailand and Indonesia."

I just don't understand why big corp seek help of these losers HH to find talent out there. This disease has even spread to Malaysia. HH are worse than rabies."
Starbucki,20170724,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 817,200904,From: Petaling Jaya,It also results in pressing down salaries as HH gets up to 12 months of your pay just for submitting your cv and get you hired. Coz the company thinks of recouping the HH commission by using you.While you do the donkey job and get abused for 12 months just to get the same.

Mikethebodo,20170724,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,201706,,"its really sad the hiring industry these days have gone down the drain. If you are a top scorer you would obviously want to apply to the best co like GE, Microsoft, Google, etc. But when you see advertisements without name of co, all posted by HH, you really don't see the incentive to have better marks because you can't choose. You don't know which co is the best. Of course if you are the best candidate you can nudge your competitors but for all you know, you see the misleading job ad, that says MNC that seek potential AVP to run multifaceted businesses. But when you are called up for interview, it turns out its a blady chinaman company that have example a VW car dealership in Cambodia, laos and Indonesia. In the past hiring used to be handled by the CO HR, now its been outsourced to HH. In the old days you can feel the face to face service and you would have a feel whether you can get the job, but nowadays you got to peel off the layers of stupid HH to get to the company HR. Also greedy HH, wants to get as many candidates they think are suitable as possible, give you false hope, to only realize the employer find you not suitable."

Starbucki,20170724,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 817,200904,From: Petaling Jaya,I never had great experience dealing with HH and HR. Hiring managers were always my best liaison.So conclusion is HR and HH are value destroyers. They get paid good money at our expense and for pushing paper. Thats why their fraternity are tight knit so they can conceal these and laugh about it among themselves.
Mikethebodo,20170724,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,201706,,"yeah me too, I got my job through hiring managers. At times hiring manager are in opposition to HR. The hiring manager wanted to accept my expected pay but HR baulk at it.HR is so pathetic, their benchmarking of salaries are so backwards and conservative. They tend to like to lowball prospective applicants. Last time I wanted join Co A badly because of its reputation but Co B offered a higher pay. I told Co A HR, that the pay I am asking is appropriate to my years of experience, but the idiot HR resisted just for RM 500. OMG, that is so pathetic. In the end I took up Co B, because my whole opinion of Co A went down the drain after I encountered such a cheapskate HR. I took it up to the hiring manager, the hiring manager wanted to offer me that pay but was scared of the cheapskate HR."

Starbucki,20170724,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 817,200904,From: Petaling Jaya,"Sounds familiar. But good riddance to Co A anyway coz if the hiring manager cant back you up, unlikely you will like the environment after you join. The worst hiring managers are those that has little say, though their intentions may be good. No balls no glory."
Mikethebodo,20170724,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,201706,,"sometimes HR managers have too much glory hole power. These are especially true for the female ones.My previous co, the HR manager was acting like the big boss because she played teacher's pet to the big boss. But one day, she was caught stealing co money, not a few hundred, like 30,000. Became a CBT case and co had to let her go. Then co decided to hire a HR exec so that this kind of problem won't happen again. Since that day, it been a job, the HR exec is submissive and no push work back to Finance."
Starbucki,20170724,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 817,200904,From: Petaling Jaya,Right again. All HR assholes happen to be women. All.I always know I wouldnt want to work in a co when the first interview is done by a female HR. Not that my chances were high tho coz probably my disdain showed. They just simply do not know what they are talking about. They ask textbook questions and then rolls their eyes when they cant understand the stuff told to them. Its a bloody waste of time. All the time.
Mikethebodo,20170724,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,201706,,"Me too, their presence cause me disdain. Even more disdain when most hiring managers leave the negotiation of our salaries to the devices of these Machiavellian HR managers. After going through 3 tiring rounds of interviews, having to go through a panel of POS interviewers interrogation and making case study presentations, it cause me so much tiredness of fighting through so many rounds that I just felt exhausted from negotiating my salary. I usually ask for 30-40% hike, but these asshole HR managers want to play cheapskate and low ball me to 15%. Usually we meet mid way 20-25%. And another issue too, some stupid hiring managers just allow HR managers to find a list of candidates for them instead of having the initiative to do it themselves. So if my asking pay is too sky high, the HR manager wouldn't even consider because they have a ridiculous HR budget to start with.When I was 26 yo, I recall applying to genting. And the joker HR wanted to hire me but I have to take a RM 200 pay cut. I was like???WTF??? who in the right mind would want to join their co?"
Starbucki,20170724,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 817,200904,From: Petaling Jaya,"Yes. And dont get me started on HR who sits on things. End result is good candidates dont get hired coz they got lost in the pile. And they get monkeys in the end. So they think all are monkeys and are ok to be lowballed. When they get good ppl like us, they use the same stupid lowball trick. Vicious cycle."

As she come into her first day of work, she found out that the doctors at the hospital can earn but to 100-200k a month and if business if bad, no patients, they shaking leg, they can get 20,000 doctor fees from the hospital. And this is what HR does, pay people they don't deem important chicket feet. I am astonished as to how low our salary rate is."
