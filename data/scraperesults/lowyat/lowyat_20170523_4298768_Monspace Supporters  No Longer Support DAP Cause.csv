joe_mamak,20170524,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...vestment-claimsThe Malay MailFracas at MonSpace HQ over investment claimsBy Danial DzulkifliWednesday May 24, 2017Lim (top right) and Liu demand an explanation from Lai over the status of her company. — Picture by Razak GhazaliKUALA LUMPUR, May 24 — Being booed and jeered at was probably not how he had expected to start his Tuesday morning.But that happened to Segambut MP Lim Lip Eng after he was given the “welcome of his life” when he visited MonSpace Sdn Bhd in Bukit Jalil yesterday. Lim, Selangor DAP committee member Ronnie Liu Tian Khiew and 19 Chinese nationals who claimed they were victims of the MonSpace investment scheme, had gone to the headquarters of the multinational company  to demand a refund or at least an explanation on why their investment did not materialise. The Chinese nationals had lodged a police report against MonSpace at the Dang Wangi police station on Monday. While waiting for MonSpace Group CEO Datuk Seri Jessy Lai to arrive, Lim — a two-term MP — and the others were given a rude reception by MonSpace supporters. The crowd continued to harass Lim when he tried to explain the claim of the Chinese nationals to reporters. The shouting only ended when Lai arrived at 11.30am. Lim asked Lai to provide proof her company is not an illegal investment firm.“We will give you two months to provide proof you are indeed running a legitimate business, a listed company in the US, and even possess a banking licence in China as you claim,” he told Lai.“I am even opening an avenue for you to sue me and my team for defamation if (our claims) are wrong.” Lim said he had lodged a report against the company over its alleged get-rich-quick scheme in January and even raised the matter in Parliament in April last year. He had also urged former Inspector-General Tan Sri Musa Hassan to clarify his alleged involvement in MonSpace and resign if he held any position in the company. “This is so you (Musa) don’t create a public perception the police are supporting the company as it will ruin the force’s credibility and reputation’’ he said.Liu, a former assemblyman, also claimed the company had not provided investors with “solid details or explanation”.He alleged it had used “gimmicks” to attract investors “but  after a year-long involvement they find out that their investment never materialises”. Lai said the company is legitimate and registered with the Companies Commission of Malaysia.She said although the company was on Bank Negara Malaysia’s updated Financial Consumer Alert list, it was not blacklisted as claimed by certain parties.“We do not advertise investment schemes or even act as an investment firm as touted by certain parties. We are involved in e-commerce or what is known as an online marketplace,” she said.“However, as the case in now under police investigation, we have left the matter to our lawyers.”On Musa’s role in MonSpace, Lai said he is the president of the MonSpace Net Inc and only involved in their e-commerce marketplace.“Being a former top cop, he would check whether we are legitimate or not before committing. It is unfair to say we are being treated biased by any parties as we follow Malaysian rules and regulations just like anyone else,’’ she said.Efforts by Malay Mail to contact Musa for comments were not successful."
