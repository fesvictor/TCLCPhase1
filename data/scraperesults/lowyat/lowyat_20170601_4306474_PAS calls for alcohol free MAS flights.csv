MsGaijin,20170601,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200812,,"PAS, MAS did a ""test"" a couple of years ago by not serving alcohol in short haul flights but that decision was criticized by some of the customers and was deemed as an unpopular policy. The later reinstatement of serving alcohol was I merely a corporate decision by the management.So, just chill a bit~ let the current management run the company and wait for further disparaging incidents."
