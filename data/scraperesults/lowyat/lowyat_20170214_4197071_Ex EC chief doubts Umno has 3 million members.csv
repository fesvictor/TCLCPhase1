Also present at the seminar were PPBM chairman Dr Mahathir Mohamad, PKR and DAP leaders.Abdul Rashid, who was with the EC for 27 years, both as civil servant and commission chief, said this was done with the encouragement of top party leaders.Umno leaders have always taken pride that its strong membership ensured its party and other candidates from Barisan Nasional component parties won in elections.Abdul Rashid said opposition parties should focus on the remaining 12 million voters to win power in Putrajaya and state governments.“But we must work very hard to woo voters in the 14th general election,” he added.Abdul Rashid said two years ago he had also proposed to Prime Minister Najib Razak to conduct automatic voter registration when citizens turn 21 but the idea was shot down.“If this exercise was implemented, the number of Malay voters in Peninsular Malaysia will increase from 59% to 69%.He also urged all opposition parties to unite to change the present government.Abdul Rashid who in November 2013, joined Malay rights group Perkasa, had admitted then as the EC chief he had to keep the dominant Malay community in power.While opening Perkasa’s Federal Territory annual general meeting that year, he was quoted as saying that the three redelineation exercises during his term at the EC, were done to ensure the continued political dominance of the Malays.EC0i8BRNJZA"
