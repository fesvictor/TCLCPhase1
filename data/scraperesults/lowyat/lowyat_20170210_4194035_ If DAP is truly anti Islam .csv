DAP was approved in 1966 under the Societies Act.Since then, DAP had operated in accordance within the framework of the law and the spirit of the Federal Constitution.""If Kamarul Zaman Yusuf is man enough to stand by his accusation that DAP is anti-Islam, then I challenge him to take legal action to get DAP deregistered as it (being anti-Islam) goes against the spirit of the Federal Constitution,"" he said in a statement today.For the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
