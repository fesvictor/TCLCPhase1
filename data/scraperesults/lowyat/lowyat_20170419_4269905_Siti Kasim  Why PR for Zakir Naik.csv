petra34,20170419,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 50,201104,,"PETALING JAYA: Lawyer Siti Kasim has criticised the government’s move to give permanent resident (PR) status to controversial preacher Zakir Naik, when numerous ethnic Indians in Malaysia are stateless.She said 300,000 Indians of Hindu and Muslim faiths have not been given citizenship although they have resided in the country for ages.“They only have PR status although they have been living here for decades. The government is delaying their citizenship,” she told FMT.“So why the need to add one more Indian (Naik) by giving him PR?” she added.Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had earlier today disclosed that Naik obtained his PR more than five years ago.He said this was before he assumed the home minister’s post in May 2013, after succeeding Hishammuddin Hussein.The government awarded Naik the “Tokoh Maal Hijrah” award in November 2013.India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) has sought Interpol’s help to issue a Red Notice (equivalent to an international arrest warrant) to question Naik on alleged money-laundering activities in India.In November last year, India banned Naik’s Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) for five years, citing his “objectionable and subversive” speeches.On March 1 this year, Siti and 18 individuals filed a suit against the Malaysian government at the Kuala Lumpur High Court registry for allegedly harbouring the preacher.They said he encouraged terrorism in public and that his presence in Malaysia was a serious threat to the country’s safety.“What is the justification for giving PR to Zakir Naik?” Siti asked, pointing out that the controversial Islamic preacher was a wanted man.She added that he had been barred from entering several countries, including the UK and Canada.“What is his contribution to Malaysia?” Siti asked.Naik yesterday told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur that the Indian authorities could interview him in Malaysia or over a medium like Skype. He also claimed he would be tortured if he returned to India"

After the First Crusade achieved its goal with the capture of Jerusalem in 1099, the invading Christians set up several Latin Christian states, even as Muslims in the region vowed to wage holy war (jihad) to regain control over the region. Deteriorating relations between the Crusaders and their Christian allies in the Byzantine Empire culminated in the sack of Constantinople in 1204 during the Third Crusade. Near the end of the 13th century, the rising Mamluk dynasty in Egypt provided the final reckoning for the Crusaders, toppling the coastal stronghold of Acre and driving the European invaders out of Palestine and Syria in 1291.so its not just christian wen killing the all ppl regardless muslims, hindus, budhist , blowing up the plane or wut. Its the usual rival ism that christian, and muslim had for centuries. fight for the holy land.

Are you even serious? Since your logic is flawed, here's an example you could probably comprehend. In an event if Company A is the official sponsor does that mean everything and everyone needs to hold and use the company's products in the event?"

So taking a slice from the evolution of Abrahamic religions in Jerusalem for example, it was and still is a holy city, which was rampas by Muslim in some 700 AD. Why Muslims rampas Jerusalem from the Jews and Christians, that is another story, maybe you know too"

On one hand talks about the perfection of the religion, how it would bring them closer to God if ABCEF is strictly implemented but yet running away, seeking refuge in countries that are liberal or free from puritanical religious laws.

LOL.Whatever that means, PAS/UMNO they can Islamicize Malaysia, but within constitutional process of course,(e.g., passing RUU355 thru parliament). But can they do it? Of course. is there any logic flaw? nope."
SpikeMarlene,20170419,Look at all my stars!!,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 5,914",200803,,"The point being,Being in the constitution as a provision for freedom to practice religions and among all the religions, Islam is recognized as official chief, does not confer automatically the legal and right to islamicize Malaysia as *anything* along that direction is also legal and rightful. For example the right and legality can be challenged if it infringes on the right and freedom of others which is enshrined in the constitution."
