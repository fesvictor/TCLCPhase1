Maybe not in the near future, but if we are capable of placing a bid, we will consider doing it in the next 20 years.""This is something that can really become a reality,"" he told reporters after attending the Olympic Day celebration at KL Sentral, here, today.Also present was Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) president Tan Sri Tunku Imran Tuanku Jaafar.Khairy's statement came three months after Tunku Imran said there is a possibility for Malaysia to bid for the Olympics after the introduction of the national Olympic Agenda 2020 in 2014.He had said that if the bidding cost for hosting the Olympics could be reduced, Malaysia might have a chance to bid for the host job, with one of the options being teaming up with Singapore to make a joint bid.""Tunku Imran had suggested to me recently to make a bid. If not as a single host nation, maybe co-hosting with a neighbouring country.""And I was made to understand that the IOC is also considering allowing more than one host nation,"" Khairy said.On Malaysia's performance in the recent Olympics and expectation for future ones, Khairy said there is a high chance the country could finally break its duck and win its first gold medal.""We can see Malaysia's involvement growing in the Olympics in terms of our contingent size, and becoming more successful in terms of medals won.""In the coming Tokyo 2020 Games, we have three to four sports that we think can win us our very first gold,"" he said.http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/06/23/...s-next-20-years"

Not ever.No country has ever profited from hosting the Olympics. Ever. Each and every country who was dumb enough to volunteer has made a loss, and the more recent ones are still busy repaying their loans and wondering WTF they were thinking. Meanwhile, all the infrastructure that was built up ended up being white elephants."

They already had most of the infra in place and managed to secure quite a lot of corporate sponsors.We have nowhere close the infra that is needed.All this 'talk' of building stuff that would be converted to general public use later has almost always proven to be hot air.That includes even the sporting facilities. Look at China's bird's nest stadium. Its pretty much falling apart.You trust our country will have better management? I really don't think so, not with their track record."
