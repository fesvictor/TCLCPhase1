But it's gonna happen, and it's not just about GDP surpassing Malaysia but overall, including the individual people's education & wealth.See the amount of Export Thailand does vs Malaysia, Thailand making alot of money from overseas sales & foreign investing in it, while Malaysia still generally relying on local market.Even now Malaysia are starting to copy from Thailand shopping mall concepts. And i see alot of Thais coming to Malaysia, end up starting own small f&b and business usually quite good, no longer focus on being bangglas. so you can see Thais are generally hardworking & willing to take risk.I don't see any reason why Thai won't be able to surpass Malaysia within 5 years time. you might say Malaysia got China, Thailand got even more China.It won't take too many decades for Malaysia & Brunei to fall into ASEAN poorest countries. Vietnam will also surpass Malaysia in around 10 years time."

So work so hard with high productivity also pointless, because HK bosses are brainless people. Some decisions they do are completely emotional and self destruction. Its a joy to work with HK underlings, because they are submissive and work hard, but superiors is another matter. I think we Msians actually have better productivity than HK people, because I know a lot of msians happen to make it big overseas like Aust, UK, HK, Sg. Even our factory workers (despite the perception that they are lazy and protek jobs), are more productive than Indonesia. I almost vomit blood when I see the way Indon factory workers work, come late, tidak apa attitude.About (1) corruption is always a big problem everywhere even in USA !!!! USA has more corruption thanyou ever think of, think about all the campaign contribution the congress and senate is getting and being influenced by big corporations.

You just read all the economic indicator and social indicators online.  Most malaysia is ahead.  Gdp ppp almost double, gdp growth we are better, corruption level we are better, cost of living we are better, public transport, we are better.  Thailand infra is even worse than indonesia.  So you think Malaysia has race problems?  In Thailand, cant you see so many fucking coups from military? Their social prob between the rich in bangkok and the poor in northern thai is much worse than here.  When did you see malaysians lose their lives due to racial clash?  How many ppl died during the red shirt vs yellow shirt in bkk in 2014?They have no election, the military plans to introduce single internet gateway like china, now if you bother to read thai news, the military gov wants to record every single Thai for social media surveillance lol. And their leste majeste law is much harsher than here.  Has anyone in Malasia been put in jail for 20 years for talking bad about sultan or islam?  How many cases in thailand you even share a fb article that criticises the king,  jail u go. ?If you measure bangkok= thailand sorry you're totally misguided.  Bangkok is the center of wealth in Thailand, where the royalty members, aristocrats, businessmen, military and police got rich.  Didn't you wonder why they don't have cities like penang or jb or kuching? Even the Indonesian that you look down is better at redistribution of wealth. Look at medan surabaya jogja balikpapan, much better than songkla korat chiangmai. If there is a civil war,it is Most likely begin in Thailand not malaysia. You don't know how the farmers or 60% of their population love thaksin right? But the loser from the king clans,  military and bangkokians are so fed up with these poor red shirt farmers they have to set a coup each time thaksin party wins the election coz there just more poor people in thailand. So no, they won't be better than us in 5 years.  Fyi they will hold an election probably next year so we might see a repeat of red vs yellow again. Mark my word"

Minister in thailand also have a habit of releasing stupid statement, equal to what we have here, some are even worst. They have the same habit of talk cock but 0 action.What u see on Thai english newspaper is the watered down peace version for international view. Serious crime or everyday crime is only reported in Thai language newspaper. In terms of snatch theft or crime that involve stealing, yes it is much lesser here. Corruption i will say is far more worst then our country. You basically need to pay for everything if u want them quicker or be more efficient, unless u have connection. Our country, gov officer is fearing MACC and audit clamp down. Over in Thailand, there is only talk cock by such ministry but no action unless very heavy constant pressure from Thai society.Thai who make it to oversea country they try hard to make things work. Not all but most Thai in their own country work extremely slow, lazy hence low efficiency, and overall just cant handle pressure well, too much pressure and they complain wanna quit.
