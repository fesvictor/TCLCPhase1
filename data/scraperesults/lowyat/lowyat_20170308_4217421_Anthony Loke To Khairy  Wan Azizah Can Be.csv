There's no need to wait for 2050,” Loke said in the Dewan Rakyat today while debating the Yang di-Pertuan Agong's royal address, referring to Permatang Pauh MP and Opposition Leader Dr Wan Azizah.Loke also flayed Barisan Nasional (BN) for its mindset of only wanting a female prime minister in 2050, which is 30 years from now, instead of supporting their current crop of female leaders.“That reflects thinking of BN. Even the most  progressive minister in the Cabinet has such a mentality. We here are prepared for a woman leader,” he said.The DAP leader also pointed out that the Malaysian Parliament has yet to have a female Speaker, saying it should follow the example set in the Selangor state assembly, where DAP’s Hannah Yeoh was made the first female Speaker.“In the Dewan Rakyat, there has not yet been a female Speaker or Deputy Speaker. We hope that soon there is a woman who can chair this House,” Loke stressed.http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...mp-tells-khairy"
