But I will say that we have our bottom line. We know our stand. We have conveyed our stand to the prime minister, so they know our stance.“As long as it is within the spirit of the Federal Constitution... that is our bottom line,” he was quoted as saying in Sunday Star today.Liow added that he will find out more about the Bill in time to come.Zahid, who reportedly said that the government will take over and table PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang’s private member’s Bill, however, did not reveal details on it.Hadi reportedly said that while PAS has no qualms about Barisan Nasional (BN) taking over the Bill, the party would like to look at the draft first.The Bill aims to raise the Shariah courts’ maximum sentencing limits to 30 years’ jail, RM100,000 fine and 100 strokes of the cane. The current limits are three years’ jail, RM5,000 fine and six strokes."
