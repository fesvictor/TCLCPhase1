It was not the DAP but it was the MCA.Datuk Loke Yuen Yaw was reported by Jabatan Penerangan Malaysia, to urge Dato Seri Najib in 2009 to create the post of Deputy Prime Minister (TPM) and Deputy Chairman of BN to be filled by the MCA President to reflect “real power sharing”.Appended below is the text of the report in bahasa Malaysia.CADANGAN TIMBALAN PERDANA MENTERI KE-II DARIPADA MCADatuk Loke Yuen Yow, Timbalan Setiausaha Agung MCA dalam laman webnya menggesa Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak mewujudkan jawatan Timbalan Perdana Menteri (TPM) dan Timbalan Pengerusi BN untuk diisi presidennya bagi mencerminkan “perkongsian kuasa sebenar”.Menurut Loke lagi, jawatan kedua Timbalan Perdana Menteri untuk presiden MCA bukan sahaja merealisasikan konsep perkongsian kuasa, tetapi juga menunjukkan kerajaan memberi kepentingan kepada peranan dan sumbangan kaum Cina dalam proses pembinaan negara.Sumber Maklumat:Jabatan Penerangan Malaysia (sini)April, 2009http://chedet.cc/?p=2414"
