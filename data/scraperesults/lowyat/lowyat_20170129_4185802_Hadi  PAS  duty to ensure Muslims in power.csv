We cannot move forward if we don't look back and reflect on our weaknesses,"" he reportedly said in a special president' address in Kedah.He said political co-operation with DAP and PKR in past elections had forced Umno and BN's defeat in 89 parliamentary seats, and wrested the popular vote.However, the imbalanced number of seats among the political parties and between Muslims and non-Muslim representatives prompted PAS to review the co-operation.""Did you realise how the seats were divided? Of the 89 opposition seats, 21 belongs to PAS, 30 to PKR and 38 to DAP.""PAS contributed 25 percent of the election machinery (for the political pact) while the other parties did their part, but the seats are not divided in the same way.""Our people were in the trenches yet the only payback was cheers of victory. Do we realise this?"" he asked.""In the 89 seats held by opposition, only 39 are held by Muslims, while 50 are by non-Muslims,"" he said.'Non-Muslim can take over'By swaying 30 additional MPs, non-Muslims can determine the outcome of a vote of no-confidence in Parliament and form a new government where only 39 MPs are Muslim while 89 are not.Hadi has consistently rejected co-operation with DAP in the 14th general election, but said PAS is open to working with Umno splinter party Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu).DAP is predominantly made up of non-Muslim members while Bersatu is the converse.PKR, which has a balance of Muslim and non-Muslim members, is maintaining talks with PAS in hopes to forge a political pact between Pakatan Harapan, Bersatu and PAS."
