Because what other choice do you have? They have said that their standards stood through time, so 5+ more years in a row anyone? I know shit nothing about the past, so I can't say anything about it. Unless you give the opposition a spin on the reign, that is, as long they keep their games up and they have a good team.And also, it's not just the problem with DAP, okay? It happened in every other party."

They back to their miserable life and continue to blame everything on BN.However, the winner candidates get salary from government and continue to blame government for everything. They are rich and they songlap too. Politicians sell hope and voters pay for it and get nothing.That sounds like the ultimate scam"
