Just the combination of Tun Dr Mahathir and Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin can be a subject of voluminous study,” Rais told Malay Mail Online when contacted.PPBM's policy and strategy bureau chief pointed out that both leaders have the needed credentials and experience to lead a coalition into the 14th general election and form the next federal government.“Tun Mahathir has led five general elections and won with two-thirds majority. Yes, he had the power of incumbency then. Despite the many challenges then he still led to win after win for BN. He still has the fire in the belly to do it with added vigour, almost on steroids, given the current state of affairs.“Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin is a technocrat, with more than 40 years experience in politics managing state, different ministries and also managing general elections and many many by-elections, certainly rich in experience,” he explained.Rais stressed that Malaysia and Pakatan Harapan need level-headed, “cool and calm leaders” to navigate the country through difficult times.“We need to be realistic with leadership. A leader is so critical toward ensuring the right stewardship and the right directions are pursued. A leader who has extensive experience,who is willing to listen and build consensus. A leader, who have been there and done that,” Rais argued.But he reiterated that PPBM's proposal remained an idea, and that the party would still have more “discussions” with PKR, DAP and Amanah until an amicable decision can be made.Rais also spoke of PPBM's membership, claiming that “tens of thousands” have joined PPBM since its formation last year.“Thousands others are joining us weekly and in some places, almost daily. Our numbers are growing and we have set up more than 150 divisions with many more branches in each divisions. It is noteworthy to mention that almost half of the members are youths,” he said.Anwar recently said he will not offer himself as Pakatan Harapan's candidate for prime minister, even as Opposition leaders continue to endorse him as “the country’s seventh prime minister”.In a statement, the jailed former Opposition leader said that debates around the issue were “tiring” as such a decision should be in the hands of voters.Anwar also rejected PPBM's proposal for Pakatan Harapan's presidential council line-up, saying that it mirrored Barisan Nasional's (BN) structure.PPBM recently proposed that Dr Mahathir and Muhyiddin be appointed Pakatan Harapan’s chairman and president, respectively, with PKR’s Anwar as adviser.In PPBM’s proposal for the official Pakatan Harapan presidential council lineup, the less-than-a-year-old party suggested that PKR president Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail be the Opposition pact’s deputy chair, PKR deputy president Datuk Seri Azmin Ali as Pakatan Harapan deputy president, and DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng and Parti Amanah Negara president Mohamad Sabu as the coalition’s vice presidents.Pakatan Harapan’s initial proposal had placed Dr Wan Azizah as chair of the federal Opposition coalition, together with Muhyiddin, Mohamad and Lim as the vice chairmen.PPBM only officially joined Pakatan Harapan in March. The coalition is planning to formally register with the Registrar of Societies, ahead of the 14th general election due by August next year.http://m.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/a...pakatan-harapan"

With Mahathir and Muhyiddin, they both have the criteria and experience. Not for long though, just enough to stabilize back our country."
