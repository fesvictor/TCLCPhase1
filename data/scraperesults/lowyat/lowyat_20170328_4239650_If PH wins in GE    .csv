kevinwawa,20170328,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 114,201105,,that is exactly y should not kick pas out

blackamikaze,20170328,Trooper Rank: BIG HEAD SERGEANT,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 2,144",200507,"From: Bestine, the capital of Tatooine","the only reason PAS keep winning Kelantan because of Kelantanese people already loyal to Passince a long time ago. Like how sarawak people keep voting for PBB. Please, the only reason PAS have win more seat because people want to change the gov, even Chinese vote for Pas just to make sure BN gone. You really think PAS suddenly have so much followers after they combine with PKR? Even their Harakah sells is going doom now..And its funny how you compare a new party like PKR with old shit like PAS that have been around since 1955 and they done nothing much to the country to be honest."

Before that no one would think Pas and Dap can work together.But PKR make it possible, and that is how the tsunami happen in our general election that a make a big dent to BN seats. Tell me, have PAS done the same before this with their so called ""1 millions"" supporters? To be honest I really want to see how strong is PAS working alone after this, let us see how their 1 millions supporters beat BN ... or just join BN to jaga muka..."

FORMER Harakahdaily editor Zulkifli Sulung just returned from the umrah and had stopped by in Istanbul for a short holiday.The day after he returned, a top PAS official met up with him to ask whether he would consider returning to work for the party news organ.Its print version Harakah is not in good shape.
