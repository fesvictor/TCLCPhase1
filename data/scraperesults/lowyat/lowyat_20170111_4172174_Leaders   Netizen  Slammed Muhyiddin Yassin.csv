We will be accused of being racists,” he tweeted.Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin also countered Muhyiddin’s remark, saying that Iskandar Malaysia was a proven contributor to the country’s economic growth.“Why didn’t he voice his views when he was deputy prime minister,” said Khaled.A retired diplomat said that Malaysia has not reached the stage where it could progress without foreign direct investments.There was nothing peculiar about China investing in Malaysia because it has also poured investments into many other countries, including the African nations, Singapore, Australia and the United States, said the former diplomat.Netizens hit out at Muhyiddin on The Star Online’s Facebook page.Sun Ce said Chinese investments were crucial because Malaysia still lacked the capital and expertise for big infrastructure projects.“Since when did foreign direct investments not benefit Malaysians – they hire local workforce and spur the economy.”Zafri Khalis said that with other countries facing their own problems, it would be a waste if Malaysia let go of the opportunity brought by the inflow of Chinese investments.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...al-say-leaders/"
