Okay lah tu,"" he said after launching Air Selangor's Save Water Campaign at the Pelangi Court apartments here Sunday.Pakatan Harapan had named PKR adviser Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as de facto leader, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia's (Pribumi) chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad as its chairman and PKR president Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail as president.Apart from Lim, the coalition also named Pribumi president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Parti Amanah Negara president Mohamad Sabu as the deputy presidents.Azmin, Pribumi vice-president Datuk Seri Mukhriz Mahathir, Sarawak DAP chief Chong Chieng Jien and Amanah deputy president Salahuddin Ayub were named vice-presidents.Communications and Multimedia Minister Datuk Seri Dr Salleh Said Keruak had questioned why DAP was not given any of the top posts in the coalition despite the party having the most number of MPs.Azmin said the Pakatan Harapan line-up consisted of old and new leaders which would be good for the rakyat and country.""Every party in the coalition has its role. We complement instead of racing against each other.""Working together as a team is more important now in facing the general election,"" he said.Asked if the line-up served as a clue as to who will be the next prime minister should the coalition wins the next general election, Azmin said it was up to the people to decide.Azmin, who is Selangor Mentri Besar, also explained why the state government had yet to sign the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission's (MACC) corruption-free pledge.""Selangor has taken an even bigger step than just pledging as the administration has a more effective and significant approach.""All members are required to sign a declaration, stating that they hold no personal interest in any working papers presented during the weekly state executive council meetings.""The same goes for the Selangor State Development Corporation (PKNS) where those involved in the board of directors meetings have to sign such a declaration before each meeting.""For the state administration, this approach is more meaningful where in the declaration, we also pledge to support MACC efforts to fight graft,"" he added.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...3H2CuiQOW7Ir.99"
