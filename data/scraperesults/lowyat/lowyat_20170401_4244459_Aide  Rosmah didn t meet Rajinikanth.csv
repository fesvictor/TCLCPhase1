It was never in her schedule, nor in her plans, in this visit to India.“Datin Seri neither interferes nor is she made aware of the prime minister's full schedule or plans and had remained unaware prior to the meeting between PM Najib and Rajinikanth,” Rizal added in a statement this evening.He said the meeting could be related to the proposal to make Rajnikanth as the ambassador for Malacca, as proposed by Tourism and Culture Minister Nazri Abdul Aziz and a non-BN Malacca MP.“Due to his immense popularity and the fact that his most recent mega-hit 'Kabali' was largely shot in Malaysia.“Rajinikanth would be the perfect person to help promote more tourism to Malacca and Malaysia - especially from Indian tourists,” Nazri added.This morning, Najib, who is on a trip to India, posted a selfie with Rajinikanth after meeting the actor at his residence in Chennai.Photographs of their meeting have also been circulating on Facebook.According to Bernama, Najib had invited Rajinikanth to shoot the sequel of his hit film 'Kabali' in Malaysia. On Wednesday, Malaysiakini quoted Indian news portal The Telegraph as stating that Najib and Rosmah had requested to meet Rajinkanth during their visit.Following this, Rizal denied that such a request was made.""Rosmah has the greatest respect for Rajinikanth and understands how huge a star that he is - both in India and in Malaysia.""However, there is no truth in recent news reports that there was a request to meet M Shivaji (referring to Rajinikanth's real name).""Neither is it scheduled for this visit to the country with one of the world's fastest economic growth this year. Speculation from unfounded sources is not helpful,"" Rizal had said."
