I decided to just go through it because at that time it was pre-GST just to spend some money before GST kicks in. No progress at all, hardly."

Also skin color as well, if person is very dark skin, the effect is hard to see.Also doctor is careful not to put laser at high power, because may end up blackening your skin. Overall for the price one pays for this procedure compared to result, it is not worth it. Unless u got a lot of free time n money. Reason being, after procedure, you can't go out under hot sun or do ourdoor activities for 2 weeks. U have to apply sun screen to prevent UV rays as your skin is already thin from the procuedure."
