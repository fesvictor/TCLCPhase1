But Anwar is a symbol of the reformasi.""He has carried that idea since he was in Umno-BN. Anwar can change Malaysia for the better.""When asked what he planned to do with the portrait, Rashid said he would display it in his office at Komtar, Penang.Johnny Ong, the painter of the portrait, said he didn't expect the price to go up that high. Instead, he thought it would only fetch RM2,000.He spent one whole day painting the portrait digitally, on his computer.""I made it specifically for the event. I wanted to contribute the portrait for this event's fund-raising programme.""It was a pleasant surprise to have the portrait sold for more than RM10,000.""Ong said he had picked a picture of Anwar to paint, based on images available on the Internet.The one he ended up choosing portrayed Anwar exactly as the true leader that Ong believed he is.""He looks charismatic and courageous … he has fought for a better future for all Malaysians.""Wan Azizah and her daughter, Nurul Izzah, were among those who attended the reformists' convention held at the Ideal Convention Centre (IDCC) in Shah Alam today.Former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad was also present. However, his presence received mixed reaction from the audience with chants of ""Reformasi"" and ""Bebas Anwar"" heard throughout Dr Mahathir's speech.http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=116036"
