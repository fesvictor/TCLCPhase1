big[1],20170227,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 588,201506,,"PETALING JAYA: A Johor Umno branch chief has been arrested for posting offensive remarks over a recent accident which resulted in the deaths of eight teenage cyclists, The Star reported.The man, who is a Datuk, was taken into custody by police at his home in Gombak, Selangor on Saturday. Police also arrested a friend of the Datuk in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. Both men have been moved to Johor Bahru.They are now being held under remand to assist in an investigation into allegations they had made on their Facebook accounts.According to police, the two men had alleged on FB that the police were withholding information about the women driver involved in the accident which occurred on Feb 18 because she was related to a VIP.Aside from the Datuk and his friend, another man was also arrested in Ipoh, Perak for making similar disparaging remarks or racially insensitive comments on social media pertaining to the accident.The daily reported the police as saying that the three men are all in their 60s.“The two suspects from the Klang Valley were held for posting offensive remarks that could threaten the country’s harmony,” Johor police chief Comm Wan Ahmad Najmuddin Mohd told The Star.Wan Ahmad added that the suspect from Perak was detained for allegedly encouraging the people to join a bicycle rally.“We have also seized four SIM cards and three mobile phones believed to be used by the men to commit the offences,” he was quoted as saying.On Feb 18, eight teenagers died, two others were badly injured and six more slightly injured when a car rammed into them as they were cycling along Jalan Lingkaran Dalam in Johor Bahru at about 3am.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...cling-accident/"

Unless you are saying they don't.  Why can't she drive on the highway at 2-3 a.m.?  It is a free country.  You too can drive on the highway at 2-3 a.m.I wouldn't have any of my family riding a modified bicycle on a highway at 2-3 a.m. in the morning.
