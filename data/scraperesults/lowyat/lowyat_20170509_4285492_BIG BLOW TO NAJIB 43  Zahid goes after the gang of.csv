expendables,20170509,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201310,,"He is loudly pronouncing that Jho Low (aka Eric Tan) is now touchable and can be nabbed. No one dare touch Jho Low in past.If you read the tea leaves, this is one of Zahid many subtle moves contradicting his boss. Which is why his boss quickly promoted Hisham recently and that is a slap to Zahid.Zahid knows his position is shaky and he has to make his move or he will be moved. But all this battle royale between Umno #1 and 2 only happen after upcomin GE. For now, both sides just bottling it up as they need each other. After GE14, Umno will implode"

But but with moneh one can easily get Zimbabwe passports as well, so not a big blow after all."
