With this his credibility is all but gone... How to trust someone that claims to be independent yet is a propaganda agent? IMO it's worst than trusting a politician that clearly tells you he belongs to either side of the fence. If you trust LSS, you are trusting a serial liar that has no respect for his readers and audience.Bonus pic» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «"

Kaerna,20170621,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 282,200802,,"I'll just leave this article here. Better save it before The Star pulls it out.» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... « The anonymous Facebook political commentator says his/her aim is to make the public sift the truth from the propaganda.I MET for the first time an object of curiosity among political aficionados on Facebook. An anonymous Facebooker named Lim Sian See has been attracting a following with his/her wry comments on Opposition politicians.On Wednesday, I had a lunch meeting with the Facebooker in a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur.Later, I had a question-and-answer session with him/her on WhatsApp.Q: Is your name really Lim Sian See?A: No, it is not. Its a pseudonym - much like Chedet, Mark Twain or Lewis Carrol.Q: Why do you remain anonymous?A: I am not a politician or in any political party or NGO, and I do not harbour any future ambition to do so. I see no need for me to publicly claim any recognition.Q: Does the public know who you are? Do those you target know who you are?A: Dozens of people know but not the public in general.In fact, the majority of my Facebook friends and followers are aware that this is not my real name. One person even commented that he doesnt even care if I am actually a living table as long as what I write is true and backed by evidence and facts.The authorities know who I am for sure. In fact, Special Branch officers have visited me twice to ascertain my identity. Therefore, I am very careful to make sure whatever I post is not defamatory or untrue.I do believe that those I target know who I am but for reasons known only to them, do not want to expose me  perhaps to avoid giving me free publicity.Q: Why did you start posting political commentaries on Facebook?A: Right after the 2013 general election, I was inspired by the lies about the 40,000 Bangladeshi phantom voters and (tallying centre) blackouts. Many of my professional friends and successful businessmen  people I consider smart and educated  were totally sucked in by these lies.I have also posted a RM50,000 reward for information on where these so-called blackouts happened. To this day, the reward remains unclaimed.Much of the information received by many supposedly smart Malaysians has been controlled and manipulated by social media and so-called independent news portals.To give you an example of how independent they are, exactly one year ago, Api Api assemblyman and PKR deputy Sabah state chairman Christina Liew was found by the High Court to have acted unlawfully by inducing 819 poor landowners in that state to breach a land deal with a state-owned firm. The court ordered her to pay RM557mil in damages.This was easily the single biggest instance of court-awarded damages ever in Malaysia but none of the independent press mentioned a word of it. Neither did any of the Pakatan leaders. The way I see it, Barisan Nasional has been doing a poor job in social media while there are many pro-Pakatan/anti-BN social media users  you can call it my little contribution to strike the balance.Q: You told me that you didnt know who Lim Guan Eng was before GE13. How is that possible?A: In 2012, I had no interest in politics at all and was just focusing on my career. I had heard of Lim Kit Siang but did not know who Lim Guan Eng was, even though he was the Penang Chief Minister. I even thought Gerakan was the northern branch of MCA.I do not find this unusual. In fact, if you ask many people who the Mentri Besar of Negri Sembilan or Kelantan is, they wouldnt be able to tell you.Q: How did you turn from someone who did not know who Guan Eng was to a political animal?A: I wouldnt call myself a political animal  probably a political enthusiast. I just spend lots of time reading the news, Googling and talking to people to catch up. Its not that hard, really.Q: You like to use the word zombie in your postings. Define Zombie.A: Zombies are those inspired by the lies about the 40,000 phantom voters and the blackouts. They are like the zombies that you see in Hong Kong movies.They are unthinking, and when the Tao master rings the bell, the zombies would hop and follow. These zombies are devoid of independent thought and just swallow everything their political masters and independent news portals say.Q: How does one become a zombie?A: By not reading both sides of the story before making a judgement.The worst zombies are those who read the headlines from the independent press without bothering to read the article and immediately come away with a conclusion. These zombies are the easiest ones to fool.Q: Can Barisan supporters also be zombies?A: They can if they do not think logically and just lap up propaganda.Q: Do you think your postings will translate to votes for Barisan?A: That is not my primary objective. My primary objective is to help sift the propaganda and lies from the truth.Q: Why are Lim Guan Eng, Tony Pua and Rafizi Ramli your favourite targets?A: I do post more about these three. But mainly because they make the most public statements.Q: How come you cant spell Rafizis name?A: You have to be careful with the PKR types, as they are quite touchy. Their party leader (Datuk Seri) Anwar Ibrahim is famous for his You ulang, I saman (If you repeat, I will sue).Q: How do you see the political atmosphere in Malaysia?A: I am deeply concerned. I share the view of Singapores senior ambassador Bilahari Kausikan who said this to Tony Pua recently.I am not against idealism but even idealism, if it is to take a political form, must be grounded in reality. If an individual dies for his or her ideals, we can call the person a martyr or a fool and in any case, since only one individual is involved, it may not matter too much. But if an erstwhile political leader deceives himself and his followers into chasing an impossible dream and so leads them into disaster that can only be called irresponsible.That gives you an idea why he and I believe Malaysia is treading on dangerous ground  based on a hope that is not realistic  while our opposition politicians reap the benefits of position, power and fame.The views expressed are entirely the writers own.http://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnis...h-lim-sian-see/"

FatalExe,20170621,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 229,200801,,Because he's semi famous nowadays and news outlets are quoting him more and more often -- see NST and The Star asking for his opinion on everything from political stuff like BERSATU to economic stuff like Proton-Geely sale. Thus it means his ramblings and opinions does have an effect on the public. His credibility is higher than the average ktard because of that. Therefore it's semi-relevant and in public interest to raise this awareness

Now we know he isn't any nonpartisan person, he has an agenda and is paid to do so.It damages his credibility and leads us to think whether his writings are legit or spun to fit his narrative.Besides, his economic analysis is widely known as being pseudo-economics, much like pseudoscience, are more like ramblings and twisting statistics to fit his agenda.For example, he likes to use GDP values to convince followers that Malaysia is a superb country economically because it means we can afford expensive shit. However basic college students already know that GDP is not an accurate measure for citizen welfare, and he is conveniently ignoring the poor communities in FELDA/kampung etc.Recently he even defended FGV by saying the are a super profitable and well managed company according to financial reports while virtually everyone in the palm oil industry knows how corrupted the FGV deals are."

Kaerna,20170621,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 282,200802,,Seriously if he's confident about his fact he doesn't need to hide behind an identity and claim to be neutral or not politically link to be able to present his views. In fact it will make BN look strong and 'not afraid' in the long run (you don't see Trump denying his critics behind a Pseudonym don't you)Kinda sad that even BN themselves understand that Newspapers and other mainstream media has close to no credibility they have to resort to MSM quoting an 'anonymous' blogger as news source.Sad times for journalism around the world.I think more chinese  at this rather than kepanasan.

It is like talking to dead people.Lim Sian See is not able to hold any intelligent talk with anyone. When presented with facts and not able to defend himself, he just simply block that person from his FB or sites, and delete the intelligent posts. I cannot see how any one should be upset over Lim Sian See who very obvious is tidak berapa cerdik. The fact that Bee End uses orang tidak berapa cerdik and some people actually follow a tidak berapa cerdik shows how cerdik some people are. However if I were BN I would use such person to brain wash the lagi tidak berapa cerdik.Like some one said correctly, this Eric See does have a mahu kena tumbuk face, and one forumer's comment was right - only his mother would love his face."
