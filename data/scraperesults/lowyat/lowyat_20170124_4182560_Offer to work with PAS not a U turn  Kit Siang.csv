Is Hadi prepared to make such a commitment?” Lim said today during a visit to Bukit Gelugor, Penang.PAS ended ties with Lim’s party after DAP repeatedly attacked Hadi’s ambition to implement an Islamic Penal Code in Kelantan in 2015. The break-up ended the Pakatan Rakyat coalition.PKR and DAP later formed Pakatan Harapan, a new coalition with Amanah, a new party formed by former PAS progressive leaders.Pakatan Harapan is now working with former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) to fight BN.Lim, who is Gelang Patah MP, said he could work with Mahathir even though they could continue to disagree on many political questions.“…Yet (we) can come together on the larger agenda of rescuing Malaysia from becoming a global kleptocracy and a failed rogue state,” he said.Last night in Ampang, Mahathir reportedly said the time was up for PAS to decide on whether to form an electoral pact with the opposition.The PPBM chairman said the call had to be made soon, as PPBM would make its decision at its supreme council meeting.He said if possible, they wanted all five opposition parties together in a single coalition.“But sadly, PAS has a stance which has made it difficult in the unification process,” he said, adding that PAS had previously insisted that it will never cooperate with the DAP and Amanah.Mahathir also explained that PPBM had previously attempted to convince PAS to join the opposition coalition, but dialogues with the Islamist party had so far involved “slightly lower level of the PAS leadership”, without Hadi taking part in the talks.-----------------------------------------------------------Big ifs."

joe_mamak,20170124,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,PAS did.  They also adhered to it.  Then Nik Aziz passed away.  Why you so disappointed with DAP?  This is Lim Kit Siang's own views.......He said so.  The party has not endorsed his views.

So what does this shows PAS as a party? They just untrustworthy to keep their words?   I really hope DAP don't listen to LKS this time even if PAS comes crawling back with promises to the sky"

joe_mamak,20170124,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"LKS sees a bigger problem for Malaysia.  Those big ifs, if PAS agrees, LKS thinks PAS can work together with DAP again.  Maybe all this is just a big gesture from LKS.  He knows PAS will say no.   After all, there is still Amanah which is the elephant in the room.  As it is, PAS will not work with Amanah......  There is so much bad blood.  Well, anyway, LKS has tossed the ball into PAS' court.  Lets see what happens next."

Using excuse like kleptos#&t to cover the reason you want to win the GE so much. since the last two years, this old fag has been feeding blatant lie that Malaysia is going bankrupt in next year, but so far nothing happens, not even close. Keep bragging and lying again, and I have the pleasure to watch you jilat the next months. Politician like this has no credibility. No more vote for this guy. Najib and his ministers have been working all day all nite and have achieved a lot of things that even the blind can't deny, yet this guy play politics 24/7/365 mcm tiada kerja lain. Shame on you. Only the weaklings keep barking, while the strongs keep silence and do. Im expecting more barking this year."
