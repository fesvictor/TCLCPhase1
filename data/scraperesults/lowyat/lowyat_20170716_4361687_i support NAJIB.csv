powerlinkers,20170717,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,201706,,"I agree with you.Najib is corrupt but his economic policies have kept us growing.I comment based on his economic policies, the only Prime Minister did better than Najib was his father.Mahathir had golden years when Anwar Ibrahim was his finance minister.Many Malaysians really fail to understand overhaul done by ETP and Pemandu.Malaysia was one of the countries trapped in middle income trap in year 2009.Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was not intelligent enough even to understand the mess he placed Malaysia and middle income trap.Badawi did the worst by increasing budget deficit to -6.7% in year 2009 prior his departure.ETP and Pemandu has changed multiple Malaysian economic policies, liberalized Malaysian economy and increased FDI.We are currently experiencing a short setback and correction mechanism is in place for ringgit to appreciate against USD to reach its fair value.Technological revolution is sweeping through Malaysia, GDP growing at more than 5% p.a, and budget deficit is less than 3% for year 2017.We should become a developed country by year 2020.Socialism will destroy a country, Scandinavian countries would have been multiple times richer than USA if they didn't adopt socialist policies in 1950. Malaysia might end up like Venezuela literally if we adopt opposition socialist policies.I am not scaremongering Malaysian Chinese: this is the reality , if you adopt socialist policies: you would make the lazy to get free money even though they don't work. and the rich and intelligent people need to subsidize these people. In the end, when less people turns to work, the system collapses. Please read about south american socialist countries."
