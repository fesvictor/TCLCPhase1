It is also not a Chinese party as, right from its formation 50 years ago, the party has been committed to serving all Malaysians, regardless of race, religion or region, he said.Lim said the election will be a test of whether voters will support BN or whether the information age has changed the political and electoral equation by creating greater awareness among voters, including in the semi-urban and rural areas, to vote for “a democratic Malaysia”."

That is like saying even though you dominate the country, you still need 'bantuan khas', because other people are doing better due to their own efforts.

It isn't possible numerically.  The number of Malays running would very likely outnumber the number of non-Malays running.    What are the chances of PH winning and DAP having the most number of MPs in the coalition.  That's possible.  But how many seats would DAP be contesting?  In the last GE, DAP fielded 51 candidates.  They won only 38 seats, of which 2 are won by Malays.  36 out of 222 is less than 17%.  Possible for Malays to lose political power?  I don't think so."

You can see from the figures I have posted earlier.  Your come back is nothing much really.  It is akin to having just one very charismatic Chinese MP to lead all the MPs to follow what he says.  Your argument would end when there is not even a single Chinese MP in Parliament

It will come to a time when ur hak istimewa is no longer relevant when the population of the privileged one increases and the minorities keep shrinking. That time, when you are the 80% majority, u r basically competing among yourself. The minorities are actually worried and many migrate to other countries because they felt as 2nd class citizen and not appreciated. If u keep harping about this keistimewaaan, someday you will lose the competitive edge and all other countries will take over us. It's already happening anyway.

silic0sis,20170425,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,200508,,"Tongkat thing is bad because it destroys the growth of malays, it destroys the social and racial harmony because it creates an us-versus-you situation, it's racist and it affects malaysian economy and growth.The thing is, you can't talk about multiracial multicultural when there's a racist policy and when the policy itself counters the ideology of a multiracial country.You can't antagonize the minority and then say you want racial harmony. It's like I spit on your face daily, but tell you not to be angry at me, it doesn't make sense.But the thing is, why does race even matter, why is there such a thing as hak melayu or concepts of chinese taking over. Race doesn't mean anything and it is something completely beyond our control, we are all humans in the end, what does it matter if one human or another human is in charge?The reality is, most malaysians probably have some mixed blood, ""pure"" malays are probably rare, many probably either have some chinese or indian or both blood. Some have middle eastern or western blood as you can see with royal family. I have some malay blood too although I'm not bumi. In the future there will be even more assimilation, the bloodlines will be even more mixed between races.The concept of ""privilege"" is flawed anyway, because it truly does not matter.If you are rich, would you be upset if another Chinese guy is also rich? Would you think, only I can be rich, you can't?If you are happy, would you be upset if another Chinese guy is also happy? Would you think, only I can be happy, you can't?Because that's what you're fighting for even though it may not appear that way. Think about what privilege is. It means I can have something but you can't which is totally flawed and unnecessary. As long as I don't hurt you or take away your rights or your ability to be happy or successful, why does it matter? We can both be happy and successful together.It is better for everyone, if everyone works together and be successful and happy together, and in reality that is the only way for the country to truly grow.About royal families and royal institutions, I guess it's tradition, like in the UK. But the country will be perfectly fine without them. As religious heads, in theory, they only have true value if they can hear God's voice, otherwise how are they different from anyone else. But if people want to keep them there and pay for their well being and pay for all their luxuries, then its fine, although it's actually a weird thing when you think about it lol. It's like if your great great great great parents were once kings, everyone in the country should pool their money together to pay for all your expenses and luxury goods. But if people want to keep royal institution in place because of tradition it's fine."

However, a black guy doing the same thing would be OK.Another thing that I think many Malays may not realize is, everyone wants Malays to be successful.If Malays are successful, there won't be a need for racist policies like NEP that tears the country apart. If Malays are successful, they won't have so much hatred for other races. If Malay's are successful, the country will grow at a much higher and faster pace, everyone will have more purchasing power.

Dua kali bhai.Lepas tu tolong sama Lapuiji dan backup Langkah Kajang .... yang aftereffects finally saw PR breakup, Anwar in jail, Pas splintered .... so you think Malays in oppo pun tak notice ke?Eh aku pun lagi lama menentang UMNO regime since aku politically matured. Tapi tengok DAP punya shenanigans since 2008 macam kera dapat bunga siap acah2 biadap kat Royalty, sampai nak masuk campur games of throne dalam Malay oppo politics di Selangor sehinggalah one of the most powerful oppo blocs in history ie Pakatan Rakyat hancur lebur.So jangan cerita la idealistics or rhetorics or whatever when realpolitics shown differently.And yes, never in my 38 years of age ever seen divisiveness like the current political struggle in 2016-2017.Its all gone down to its either us vs them mentality, Malays vs Chinese ..... itu realiti kat grassroot level. Bila two thirds of Malay majority rasa DAP public enemy no. 1, things ain't that easy for DAP led PH.So hadam. DAP kena pikir along the way macam mana nak damage control a few missteps yang dilakukan from 2008 till now.Sedangkan Indonesia yang level Republik pun dah berapa kali hentak Chinese, kat Philippines Chinese pun hanya cukur dapat menten bisnes, dekat Thailand Chinese kena held in check by military and Royalty .... Malaysia?Malaysia je Chinese betul2 ada political power to atleast effects a few changes for the benefits of Chinese in Malaysia. Ada la something dari takde langsung.Even Singapore got kicked to the curb in 1965 from Malaysia should thanked its lucky stars to become the most successful Chinese polity ever sans Taiwan and China."

Non-bumis were ok with giving away some rights to help malays grow and develop because it is understood that for malaysia to progress to the next level, malays have to first develop to the next level since malays are the majority. But realistically, in nations where similar affirmative action policies have been implemented, the outcome is negative. For example with blacks in the US. There is quite a lot of research on this topic and it's heavily debate but the numbers are the numbers.The NEP was also meant to be temporary, but it didn't achieve what it set out to do. My opinion is that in general, there is no shortcut to success. For a group of people to develop and become successful, you can't give quick handouts and expect them to suddenly change and become successful. They will remain the same and instead end up relying on the handouts. You have to change the culture of the group and change the mentality and mindset, through various means like education. The change won't be instant and the results won't be instant."

The majority of the malays fear that they cannot compete with their fellow countrymen. Hello, what year is it now? how many years since independence and NEP? If the malays still have the inferiority complex to compete then there is something really wrong.For the chinese, their concern is the livelihood, opportunities in career advancement and a better place for the future generation. Gripping into power and ruling others is not in the plan. While the malays are still worrying about how the chinese will rule over them , the chinese are more concern about the fate of the country such as the economic downtrend, weakening currency, declining in education standard, and the less tolerance exhibited by religious extremist. This is the reason many left the country. The one who stay are actually fighting to reverse the rotting process. But I can see that they are fighting a losing war...as long as the majority do not change or progress, nothing can be changed."

Other countries are moving forward as a whole, while Malaysia continues to be mired in internal divisive issues.  So much so, the real and immediate issues affecting everyone is ignored or obscured.  Wake up lah........."
