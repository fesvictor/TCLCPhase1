Kakitangan dan sukarelawan BERSIH 2.0 telah menghabiskan masa selama dua jam di SPR Shah Alam pada 6 Mac 2017 untuk memantau dan menyaksikan lebih daripada 20 orang pengundi baru yang hadir di di pejabat Suruhanjaya Pilihan Raya (SPR) Selangor untuk berdepan dengan pembantah-pembantah mereka. Salah seorang pegawai SPR memberitahu BERSIH 2.0 bahawa mereka menangani 100 kes setiap hari.Selepas pengundi berjaya mengemukakan bukti bahawa mereka adalah pengundi sahih, pegawai SPR yang bertugas memaklumkan bahawa pampasan sebanyak RM100 wajib dibayar oleh pembantah, tetapi ini terpulang kepada pengundi untuk menuntut pampasan tersebut.Ekoran pemerhatian kami, BERSIH 2.0 juga telah menerima aduan sepanjang proses ini:Sekurang-kurang tiga orang pembantah adalah ahli jawantankuasa UMNO Bahagian Petaling Jaya Selatan.Sekumpulan pembantah yang terdiri dari lelaki dan wanita dinampak menerima arahan dari seorang individu mengenai pengundi mana satu yang dibantah.Seorang pengundi yang baru didaftar menuntut wang pampasan, tetapi pembantahnya menjawab bahawa pampasan akan dibayar dalam masa 3 bulan oleh sebuah “agensi” dan bukan diri sendirinya. Apabila seorang sukarelawan BERSIH 2.0 mengambil gambar pertukaran tersebut, seorang lelaki menghalang dan merampas telefon beliau. Dia mengatakan bahawa dia berasal dari “Jaringan Melayu”.Seorang lagi pengundi baru mendakwa pembantahnya tidak sedar bahawa dia telah mengemukakan sebarang bantahan. Pembantah memberitahu pengundi bahawa dia telah diberikan arahan oleh UMNO Selangor untuk menghadirkan diri di Pejabat SPR pada hari tersebut.Seorang pengundi baru terkejut menemui jirannya yang biasa ramah terhadap dia merupakan pembantahnya yang mendakwa si pengundi tidak menduduki alamat yang didaftarkan.SPR mempunyai tugas untuk menjamin hak pengundi dan mengelakkan penyalahgunaan proses. Berdasarkan penemuan ini, BERSIH 2.0 mengemukakan persoalan-persoalan berikut kepada SPR:Adakah bantahan secara beramai-ramai tanpa alasan kukuh ini merupakan suatu perancangan secara sengaja, terutamanya di Selangor?Berapakah kes bantahan yang diterima oleh SPR pada tahun 2016 dan apakah peratusan pengundi baru yang menghadirii sesi pendengaran yang ditetapkan?Apakah mekanisme penguatkuasaan untuk memastikan pampasan RM100 dibayar kepada pengundi baru jika bantahan terhada mereka ditolak? Sekiranya terdapat 100 bantahan yang ditolak dalam satu hari, ini akan menghasilkan jumlah dendaan sebanyak RM10,000 sehari.Tambahan lagi, ini bukannya kali pertama isu ini ditimbulkan, malah ia sudahpun berleluasa selama sekurang-kurangnya dua tahun. BERSIH 2.0 pernah menerima aduan ini seawal tahun 2015, dan Ahli Parlimen Serdang, YB Ong Kian Ming pernah membangkitkan isu ini pada bulan September 2015.Adakah pembantahan-pembantahan ini wujud secara khususnya di Selangor sahaja ataupun seluruh pelosok negara?Bagi pengundi-pengundi baru yang akan didaftarkan pada suku pertama tahun ini (Januari-Mac 2017) yang bimbang dengan status mereka, BERSIH 2.0 menyeru mereka untuk menyemak status pengundi di laman SPR (http://daftarj.spr.gov.my/daftarj/) menjelang April 2017. Hasil carian laman sepatut menunjukkan nama pendaftar sedang diproses. Sekiranya mereka menerima surat bantahan, mereka perlu menghadiri sesi pendengara, jika tidak nama mereka tidak akan didaftarkan.BERSIH 2.0 mengucapkan syabas kepada pengundi-pengundi baru didaftar dan menyeru kepada mereka yang dibantah untuk hadir ke sesi bantahan untuk demi hak mengundi mereka. Kami menyaran semua pengundi baru sahih untuk berdepan dengan isu-isu ini untuk menghubungi BERSIH 2.0 supaya kami boleh meminta penjelasan dari SPR.Ditandatangani oleh ahli-ahli jawatankuasa pemandu BERSIH 2.0"

FatalExe,20170308,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 229,200801,,I don't believe that you have watched the whole 1 hour because you don't even seem to know what's going other than talking about their previous exposes. I don't think you realized that the press conference focused on youths and their statements and not the BERSIH committee. If you feel pathetic after watching it then you are a horrible Malaysian. The youths totally would risk their lives by revealing their faces and lie to the public a press conference. But by all means continue to live in your bubble thinking that these are all conspiracies.

I apologize for acting emotional because you triggered me by saying that they are pathetic. Youths are getting suppressed. Maybe you are just an Internet troll, but if you're not, I hope you will revise your opinion on UMNO.Look, I know that you are supporting UMNO. I am not a blind Pakatan Supporter.

Hopefully everyone that every registered voter go show up and fix the mess that the old fags created. There must be at least a million new voters that got them spooked.

FatalExe,20170308,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 229,200801,,"It's alright I've put him on ignore list already. We registered as new voters as per usual but we received letters from SPR a few weeks ago that we are under investigation since there were protests(bantahan) lodged against our residence address. If we did not turn up for the investigation, our names will be struck off the voter registration list. There is no second chance or second hearing.On that day, as the BERSIH video stated as well, the voters were overwhelmingly young Chinese voters. 95% chinese and 5% indian. I shit you not. The bantah gang went in and out of the investigation room, which means they filed the invalid and fraudulent complaints. It is also revealed in the BERSIH video that they were from UMNO Selangor, which is the whole controversy now.A quick search on FB reveals tons of Chinese in Selangor has been summoned for investigation. Lots of them are unable to attend due to the last minute notice, and their voting rights are gone just like that.  The SPR judge knew what was happening anyways, but I don't think he could have done much. There are many more bantahan investigation sessions in these few weeks, next Monday is one that I can confirm is happening. SUHAKAM and Bar Council will be sending observers there."
FatalExe,20170308,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 229,200801,,"Because the voters proved that their address is valid. On the contrary, anyone who could not have made it to the investigation would have their names struck off. It doesn't matter if SPR approve the people who attended the investigation, the problem is that UMNO is lodging false bantahans and banking on the fact that people could not make it to the investigation and thus suppressing their votes. Also, in the BERSIH video, it is revealed that the pembantahs possess SPR voter lists which should not be happening. SPR also did not help the youths when they seeked their help. The incident is happening on SPR office itself and yet they turn a blind eye. It is evidence that SPR is in cahoots, no?not sure why you think that I'm a girl or this is about my supposed ""boyfriend"" though."

PappyBoyington,20170309,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"Let the courts decide loh. KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 — A few Chinese Malaysians have complained that they encountered objections against their registration as voters ahead of the next general election.Such objections meant that they would have to attend Election Commission (EC) interviews at its office to prove that they are legal and eligible voters, failing which their registration as voters would be cancelled.Elaine Lee, who posted a photo of several Chinese Malaysians flocking the EC office in Shah Alam on her Facebook page, said she had accompanied her 26-year-old boyfriend to the EC’s office after he received a letter that said his application to be a voter had been rejected.Lee claimed that the office at the PKNS building was packed with both Malays and Chinese people when they arrived at about 11.15am Monday.“But the Malays were there as the ‘pembantah’ (objectors) to the cases they filed against the ethnic Chinese,” she told Malay Mail Online when contacted.Lee said her boyfriend received a letter about two weeks ago saying that someone had objected to his registration to become a voter at the Petaling Jaya Selatan parliamentary and Taman Medan state seats.“The reason stated by the person who objected to my boyfriend’s application was that (he was a) ‘pemilih diragui’ (suspicious voter), which I find it to be very ridiculous because that was the only thing mentioned,” she said.She said they had to wait for about three hours to meet the EC officer for not more than five minutes to approve her boyfriend’s registration.Lee said she was also unsure of the objector’s whereabouts, further alleging that each objector had objected to multiple voters’ registrations.She, however, added that most of the voters’ registrations were approved after the EC officers found insufficient evidence for the claims made by those who rejected the applications.Lee said neither she nor her boyfriend questioned the person who objected to his application.“I was so angry about [the incident] so I decided to share this on Facebook. I know a lot of people are getting objected,” she said.When contacted, Bersih 2.0 head Maria Chin Abdullah said her electoral reform group has received many such complaints.“But I don’t think one can conclusively say the Malays objected the Chinese… maybe that day, there were more Chinese applicants,” Maria said.When asked if these applicants come from federal Opposition-held areas, she said complaints Bersih received came nationwide and were not limited to any particular constituency.Aside from the EC, applicants can register as voters at the post office, district offices and the Department of Special Affairs.Maria criticised the EC and the government for failing to tackle the issue.If or when there is an objection, Maria said the EC should cross-check with the National Registration Department before calling up the applicant.“If the applicant is applying in… say Selangor, but currently is in Johor, it is unfair to ask him or her to come down on a particular date to be physically present,” she said.She explained that if the applicant fails to show up on the date set by the EC, his or her registration as a voter will be cancelled.To make an objection, Maria said the objector will have to fork out RM100 for each objection form.Malay Mail Online’s efforts to reach the EC chairman on the matter proved futile.Separately, Maria said voter registrations have been “slow” and accused the EC of not meeting its target.“There is a backlog of four million voters in the country, which means the EC will have to register about 150,000 new voters every quarter,” she said.With the current system used to register voters, Maria said the backlog of voters will remain, pointing that there were between one and two million unregistered voters last year.After 2013, political parties were no longer allowed to assist the EC to register new voters.  - See more at: http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...h.TPAtbzOq.dpuf"

a_dot_el,20170309,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201009,,"Thanks for the clarification. Also, purchasing the list for RM80K is a small sum to UMNO, heck to any party. RM80K is nothing nowadays. And if spending that 80K can helps your chances to win, it is definitely worth it. Why? Because bantah is an effective way to temporary prevent targeted people from voting. While spending RM80K to give beras and what not, has no guarantee that the recipient will vote for you. So you pay 80K to buy the list, and from the list you bantah 10K people, and assuming 7K responded and you loose, so you pay fine of 7K x RM100 = RM700K. So 700K + 80K = RM780K to win. Not bad. Still less than 1mil. Again this is assuming 70% responded to your bantah, which the real figure may be even lesser."

They told us face to face that pembantah have to pay themselves, but they blatantly refused to pay in front of the officers."
eaglehelang,20170309,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 980,201009,,"Got pic, name of the pembantah :https://www.facebook.com/BERSIH2.0OFFICIAL/...362449297127150*Dubious protest against my voter registration and unable to obtain compensation*My name is Jack and I am a first-time voter in the P105 PJS Parliament Seat and N33 Taman Medan DUN that registered a few months ago.On the 13th February 2017, I received a letter from the Election Commission of Malaysia (Suruhanjaya Pilihan Raya Malaysia), specifically from the Pejabat Pilihan Raya Negeri Selangor. The letter was titled ""NOTIS BANTAHAN KE ATAS RANG DAFTAR PEMILIH TAMBAHAN ST 3/2016"".The letter stated that someone raised an objection against my voter registration and I have to make myself available on 6th March 2017 for a public investigation (siasatan awam) in the SPR Selangor Office. The letter clearly stated that if I failed to turn up, my name would be or might be struck off the voter list (Rang Daftar Pemilih Tambahan).According to the letter, the reason for the objection was ""Pemilih Diragui"" and no further details were given.*The day of the investigation*As summoned, I made myself available and skipped my university classes to attend the public investigation with my sister accompanying me in the SPR Selangor office. Upon arrival, I registered my attendance in the front desk of the office and handed over supporting documents such as utility bill, birth certificate and the copy of the Borang A voter registration form. After a few moments, I was called into the Bilik Bicara SPR and swore an oath to tell the truth to the best of my abilities in front of a Judge and the person who protested against me (pembantah). I was asked questions such as my area of residence, mother's name. The judge crossed check with his documents and declared that SPR has no reason to strike off my name in the voter list. He then ordered the pembantah (a female lady) to pay me RM100 as compensation as her objection caused me inconvenience.After that, I went out of the room and proceeded to sign my signature to complete the investigation process. I caught up with the pembantah and asked her to pay me the compensation of RM100 as stated in the documents and by the judge. To my surprise, she told me that she is not the one who should pay me and that ""someone"" would contact me after 3 months when it is confirmed that I am in the voter list. As it sounded suspicious, I proceeded to ask her how would the ""someone"" contact me when I have not given out my personal details and who is the ""someone"". She told me not to worry and that ""pejabat akan settle"" and that ""bukan mak cik yang bayar"".I pressed her for more details and the reason for her protest against me but she proceeded to say ""mak cik bantah untuk pastikan kamu memang duduk kat rumah"", but contradicted herself a few moments later by saying ""bukan mak cik yang bantah you, pejabat yang suruh mak cik bantah"". As the statements were contradictory, I asked her whether she was referring to SPR as the ""pejabat"". She denied that it was SPR and said ""mak cik pun tak tau siapa"" and that I shouldn't worry and ask so much.As she was telling me not to worry and ask, a woman approached us and told her that we have the right to know who was the supposed pejabat and how we would get our money back. The woman later identified as Ivy Josiah and took out her phone to record our conversation. Immediately after that, a man appeared and struck down her phone, telling us that he is from ""jaringan Melayu"" and warned us not to record anything.As I did not know who they were, I focused on the female pembantah and told her that we should consult the SPR officers inside whether she should pay me or someone else would pay me. She agreed and we went inside. I asked the lady officer in the front desk whether the pembantah would personally pay me, and she confirmed that ""pembantah akan bayar. Sila settle sendiri"". With that as evidence, I confronted the pembantah again and she still refused to pay the RM100 compensation by repeating her statements like ""bukan mak cik bayar"". I then asked her for the phone number of the ""pejabat"" and she told me that the number is in the letter that I received. I handed her the letter and she pointed at the SPR Office's phone number, which contradicted her earlier statements when she said SPR was not the office she mentioned. When I pointed that out, she ignored any of my questions and tried to look away.As she was persistent in denying my compensation, me and my sister questioned whether she even knew where I lived to protest against my registration. She then took out a paper, which I glanced at as a list of many voters registered in the PJS area due to the fact that my personal details (address, name, IC) as well as many others were on the list. She asked for my name which I gave her. She then said she knew where I live and went personally to my house, to which my sister replied by asking her how she managed to get through the gated and guarded residence. She said that the guards did not know anything and she said ""I bukan jumpa you seorang, ramai lagi kita jumpa kat dalam"".Immediately, a man approached us from behind and accused us of provoking them and questioned why didn't I ask the judge inside the room about these issues. I replied that the judge called us to settle ourselves and that the pembantah should pay me herself. The man repeated his statements in English and said ""until when do you want to provoke us"" and ""why not you ask SPR who should pay"", which I told him SPR clearly said pembantah should pay. As we were getting nowhere, we requested for a photograph of her IC (MyKad) which she refused and she told us ""you ingat you siapa?"" They then ignored us and any of our questions and we had no choice but to leave the office.In the end, I did not receive my RM100 compensation as I was supposed to and no one has contacted me regarding my compensation.All of the above is truthful to my knowledge and to the best of my abilities."

FatalExe,20170312,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 229,200801,,"Apparently to get the basic list (name and address), it costs at least RM50k a person for a single DUN seat according to a PAS blog. Of course, you're not supposed to share the list. Not to mention, you have to pay RM10 per objection and RM100 more when you lose the bantahan. In this case, they aren't even willing to pay at all, since SPR is in kahoots with them and don't bother to enforce even if they blatantly lie in front of the officers by saying they don't need to pay.What they are doing is mass objections without any valid reason to suppress the amount of voters and hopefully delay their registration (if you get struck off the voter list, you can only register the next quarter of the year, and it takes another quarter to process your registration. By that time I'm sure they would do another wave of mass bantahan.)SUHAKAM and Bar Council will assess the situation and send lawyers/observers for tomorrow's hearing. So we'll see how it goes."
