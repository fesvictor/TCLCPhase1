MACC director of investigations Datuk Simi Abdul Ghani confirmed that anti-graft officers were looking into the matter.The London property comprised 62 units of guest rooms and two units of three-bedroom serviced apartments.It is learnt that FIC overpaid the purchase by at least £20mil (RM110mil).FIC was established in 2013, with a focus on real estate, hospitality and oil and gas sectors."
