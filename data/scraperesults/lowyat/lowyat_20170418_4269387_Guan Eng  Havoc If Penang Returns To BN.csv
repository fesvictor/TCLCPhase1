ironmaid89,20170418,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"Snz9UyMlvD4Chief minister foresees a dirtier, bald and drier Penang if BN returns to power.It will be a catastrophe for Penang if Barisan Nasional returns to power in the state, says Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng.Speaking today, he said the Penang government was not just made up of DAP but Pakatan as a whole.This means if DAP collapses, the entire coalition will collapse as well, he said.“If Penang was under BN, clean will become dirty, green will turn botak (bald), enough water for all (will turn) to water rationing.“There will be logging; permanent forest reserves will be cleared,” he said, adding that the current government had not touched “an inch” of Penang’s reserves.“Don’t look so far, look at Kedah. They are subject to water rationing. If BN returns to Penang, there will be a ‘malapetaka’ (catastrophe) for us all,” Lim said during a press conference at Komtar.Lim was responding to an opinion piece by Dr Iskandar Hasan Tan Abdullah, a senior lecturer at the Administrative Sciences and Policy Studies School, Universiti Teknologi Mara, in Machang, Kelantan.The commentary, titled “DAP boleh tumbang di Pulau Pinang” (“DAP can fall in Penang”), which was published in Malay daily Berita Harian today.In it, Tan had forecast a 15%-35% reduction of DAP’s “influence” in the state, highlighting issues such as people being shot in the middle of the road, flash floods, higher cost of living and the general Malay sentiment against the party.Lim said the opinion piece served as a timely reminder to all Penangites to reflect on what would happen if BN took over the reins again of the state government.If BN is returned, he said, all efforts by the current Pakatan government would be put in “reverse”.It would also pave the way for Penang turning into a federal territory, as previously envisioned by Federal Territories Minister Tengku Adnan Mansor, he warned.Under the present government, Lim said, Penang kept a close watch on its forests and there was no water rationing in the state to date.“We are unlike other states where 200ha of forests are cleared. When this happens, you have water rationing,” he said, alluding to encroachment activity at the Ulu Muda Forest Reserve in Kedah.The reserve serves as an important water catchment area for Perlis, Kedah and Penang.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...-says-guan-eng/"
