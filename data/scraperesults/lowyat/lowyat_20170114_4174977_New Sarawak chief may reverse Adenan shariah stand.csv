joe_mamak,20170114,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"PAS: New Sarawak chief may reverse Adenan shariah standKhairil Ashraf | January 14, 2017Sarawak PAS says Abang Johari ""is more attentive"" towards Islamic issues.PETALING JAYA: Sarawak’s Islamic opposition party believes the new chief minister there will take a stand closer to them than his late boss when it comes to changes in shariah law.The late Sarawak chief minister Adenan Satem had ordered all Sarawak BN MPs to vote against the shariah amendments.But Sarawak PAS told FMT today that because Abang Johari Openg “is more attentive” towards Islamic issues, he is more likely to support its president Abdul Hadi Awang to amend the shariah act.The state PAS commissioner Jofri Jaraiee said: “Abang Johari is quite ‘open’. In fact, we might schedule a meet up with him so we can get some support from them.“Maybe he will give some leeway and not bind any BN Sarawak MP’s from voting in support of Hadi’s bill,” he said to FMT when contacted today.PAS is seeking to amend the Shariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1965, allowing for stiffer punishments for shariah offenders, a move widely seen as setting the stage for bringing in hudud to Kelantan.Previously, Minister in the Prime Minister’s department Azalina Othman Said has said that Putrajaya will take over the tabling of the act.SUPP president Dr Sim Kui Hian has said his BN component party will not support the shariah amendments as it isn’t in line with the Malaysia Agreement 1963."

neoexcaliber,20170114,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,Wishful thinking. They need populist policies now more than ever so I don't see Sarawak MPs changing their stance when the local populace is wary of Peninsular's brand of religious freedom.Jolokia?
