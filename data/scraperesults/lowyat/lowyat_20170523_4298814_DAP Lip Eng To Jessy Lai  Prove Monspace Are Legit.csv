We have asked him for the past two weeks to step out and clarify his involvement,” Liu said, adding however that the former IGP preferred to remain silent on the issue.Liu said he wanted Musa to resign from the organisation as his involvement might tarnish the reputation and credibility of the police.“We demand that the former IGP resign from MonSpace as people may assume that the company is being backed by the police force.”Liu and several DAP lawmakers had previously claimed that Musa and other prominent figures were involved in MonSpace’s business activities.When contacted by FMT, the former IGP refused to comment, leaving it to Lai to clarify about his involvement.Yesterday, 19 Chinese nationals lodged police reports against MonSpace, claiming they were misled into placing their money in an investment scheme by the company. They said MonSpace had promised them huge returns which never materialised.Speaking to reporters after lodging the reports, one victim said he had invested up to 140,000 renminbi (RM87,000) since March 2016.Today, Liu and several DAP members, together with the Chinese nationals, made their way to the company’s headquarters at Bukit Jalil.Liu said the Chinese nationals had come to have a discussion with Lai so that they could get back their capital.MonSpace came under scrutiny after the release of Bank Negara Malaysia’s (BNM) updated Financial Consumer Alert list on May 12, revealing companies and websites which were not authorised to receive funds in Malaysia.MonSpace had topped the list among 291 other companies.Following this, Lim, who is also Segambut MP, claimed the BNM list proved the company may be involved in illegal investment activities.He had asked the government and the Chinese embassy here to probe Lai in July last year.Lim claimed that MonSpace used a direct selling model that imposed a fee of RM500 for “normal members” and RM5,000 for shareholders.According to him, 90% of MonSpace members were Chinese nationals, with some of them investing millions of renminbi.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...tells-monspace/"
