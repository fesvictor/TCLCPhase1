Coup De Grace,20170331,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,201611,,"DAP rep Yeo Bee Yin says the raid was unnecessary and meant to intimidate Selangor opposition leaders.PETALING JAYA: The office of DAP MP Teresa Kok was raided by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) today, believed to be over the alleged misappropriation of the Yayasan Warisan Anak Selangor (Yawas) fund.This was confirmed by Damansara Utama assemblywoman Yeo Bee Yin, who told FMT that the raid on Kok’s office in Kuchai Lama, Kuala Lumpur, was meant to intimidate Selangor opposition leaders.This was because all original documents related to Yawas and its accounts were with the land and district office, she said.“If MACC wants to obtain Yawas’ documents and accounts, they should go to the land office. We only have the copy of the accounts.“It’s clear that they went to her (Kok’s) office to intimidate us, not to do their job. If they are really doing their job, they would go the land office.“I feel that the whole drama is just to dramatise the issue.”The raid followed a series of police reports lodged by Sungai Besar Umno division chief Jamal Md Yunos.The first was filed on March 14, in which Jamal alleged that politicians from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor had taken funds meant for welfare from Yawas instead of disbursing the money to eligible recipients.He identified Kok, who is DAP’s Seputeh MP, DAP’s Sekinchan assemblywoman Ng Suee Lim and a PKR rep whom he did not name as the alleged culprits.Yeo said that the documents Jamal presented to reporters after lodging the report were related to the land and district office.Soon after, Jamal lodged another police report, this time against Yeo, alleging she was involved in misusing the funds.He claimed Yeo had taken money allocated for welfare although no one had passed away. He added that he also had information from beneficiaries who had not received their due allocation.When asked if she expected to have her office raided next, Yeo said she had already informed her staff to prepare all the documents MACC might need. If the anti-graft body came to her office, the documents would handed to them, she said.“We have nothing to hide, they can come. But I will be surprised as I have personally met them last week, to address all the allegations Jamal made.“I’ve also handed over all the related documents to them during the meeting.”http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...er-yawas-funds/"

soowky,20170331,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 10,200907,From: /kay/,"MACC seizes documents from Teresa Kok's officePETALING JAYA: Anti-graft officers took away stacks of documents from DAP MP Teresa Kok's office Friday in its investigation into alleged misappropriation of funds at Yayasan Warisan Anak Selangor (Yawas).  Confirming this, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) deputy chief commissioner (operations) Datuk Azam Baki said the Seputeh MP was not in her Kuchai Lama office at the time.  The raid at about 11am took place after a search warrant was produced by the MACC officers to the office workers.  ""We contacted her and she gave full cooperation to our officers.  ""Some documents were taken to assist us in the course of the investigation,"" he said when contacted.  Azam said MACC would need to study the documents first and statements would be taken from relevant parties in due course.  He said the probe is over a report lodged with the MACC by an individual over alleged irregularities in Yawas funds.  Earlier this month, Sungai Besar Umno division chief Datuk Seri Jamal Md Yunos had lodged a series of reports, alleging that some politicians had taken funds meant for welfare from Yawas but never disbursed the money to qualified recipients.  Among the politicians he had named in the reports were Kok, Sekinchan assemblyman Ng Suee Lim and Damansara Utama assemblyman Yeo Bee Yin.sos"
