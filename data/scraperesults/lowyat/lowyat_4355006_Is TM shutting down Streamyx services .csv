Why need to shut down service since the copper wire already existed with no additional cost and able to make money. This is just telemarketer tactic to get customer. If reported to TM I guess the contract will be terminated

Chrono-Trigger,"  Jul 11 2017, 02:50 PM",Regular,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,259",Joined: Aug 2013,,"Incorrect to say no need additional cost to maintain. Copper cables got stolen , DSLAMS that need to maintain, duplication of services (Unifi and streamyx) , and ultimately the declining revenue from streamyx. Cannot be upgraded to charge more...It's like 3G and 4G networks , telcos have stopped investing in 3G now, and giving perks for customers to migrate to 4G"

If the area has fiber laid, of course the copper service will be terminated. However, for areas that have yet to be laid with fiber, the Streamyx will still be maintained because it is an obligation promised by govt to make sure wide coverage of ""broadband""."

I just got mine yesterday. 30mbps download, 10mbps upload.i couldnt be more happier after waiting for almost 4 years for a decent tiang telefon to be installed at my taman. Previously, they said streamyx but then later, streamyx project cancelled at my taman and got Unifi instead."
