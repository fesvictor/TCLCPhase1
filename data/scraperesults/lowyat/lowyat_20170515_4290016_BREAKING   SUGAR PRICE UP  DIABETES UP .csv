angelgemini,20170515,...,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,209",200506,From: Malaysia,"What is it?Sucrose (C12H22O11) is sugar, often referred to as table sugar or saccharose. Commercial sugar is usually produced from either beet or cane sugar. Sucrose has been used since antiquity for its sweetness. It is often used in medications to impart a more pleasant taste to often unpalatable chemicals. Sucrose can be found in many medical dosage forms such as chewable tablets, syrups, lozenges, or gums. Sugar-free formulations of many of these dosage forms exist as well. While sugar is essentially non-toxic, it can be associated with dental caries, exacerbation of diabetes, and weight gain.[1]Top Medications with this excipientAcetaminophen and Hydrocodone Bitartrate 325 mg / 5 mg (Qualitest Pharmaceuticals Inc.)Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone Bitartrate 325 mg / 5 mg (Watson Pharmaceuticals)Adderall XR 25 mg (Shire US Inc.)Adderall XR 10 mg (Shire US Inc.)Adderall XR 15 mg (Shire US Inc.)Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine Extended Release 20 mg (Actavis Elizabeth LLC)Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine Extended Release 20 mg (Global Pharmaceuticals)Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine Extended Release 30 mg (Actavis Elizabeth LLC)Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine Extended Release 30 mg (Global Pharmaceuticals)Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine Extended Release 25 mg (Actavis Elizabeth LLC)Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine Extended Release 10 mg (Actavis Elizabeth LLC)Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine Extended Release 15 mg (Actavis Elizabeth LLC)Atarax 25 mg (Pfizer U.S. Pharmaceuticals Group)Dexamethasone 4 mg (Roxane Laboratories, Inc.)Methylphenidate Hydrochloride 10 mg (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Inc.)Methylphenidate Hydrochloride 20 mg (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Inc.)Norco 325 mg / 5 mg (Watson Pharmaceuticals)Omeprazole Delayed-Release 20 mg (Zydus Pharmaceuticals)Phentermine Hydrochloride 37.5 mg (KVK Tech Inc.)Phentermine Hydrochloride 37.5 mg (Qualitest Pharmaceuticals Inc.)https://www.drugs.com/inactive/sucrose-74.html"
