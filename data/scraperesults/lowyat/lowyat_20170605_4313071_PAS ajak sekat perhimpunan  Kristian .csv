lshsl,20170605,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 141,201107,,"PAS ajak sekat perhimpunan ‘Kristian Zionis’ di MelakaPETALING JAYA: PAS hari ini mempersoalkan sebuah perhimpunan gereja yang bakal diadakan di Melaka bulan ini, dengan menyifatkan program itu agenda “Kristian Zionis” dan “budaya Yahudi” yang perlu disekat secara tegas oleh kerajaan.“Mutakhir ini musuh Islam mula main kasar dan makin berani. Sekarang mereka sasarkan Malaysia. Mereka mahu buat sarang di sini. Ayuh bangkit ummah sebelum terlambat,” tulis Ketua Penerangan PAS, Nasrudin Hassan di Facebook, sambil memuat naik poster acara itu.Perhimpunan itu, “Nations of the Golden Gate allignining with Jerusalem’s Jubilee”, diadakan selama 4 hari dari 15 ke 18 Jun, di Gereja Calvary Life Assembly (Chinese) di Melaka.Kristian Zionis merujuk kepada kelompok di kalangan penganut Kristian yang menganggap umat Yahudi ditakdirkan untuk “kembali” ke tanah suci di Baitul Maqdis sebelum dunia menyambut kedatangan semula Nabi Isa bagi menyelamatkan manusia.Kepercayaan ini merupakan antara yang terkandung dalam kitab Perjanjian Lama (Old Testament) yang dijadikan rujukan ajaran Yahudi.Menurut penganjur, perhimpunan itu memilih rantau Asean kerana gabungan itu menyambut ulang tahun ke-50 atau Jubli Emas tahun ini.“Mengapa tidak Malaysia?” menurut catatan mengenai program itu di sebuah portal Kristian, Christianity Malaysia.“Hati nurani Kristian merindui kehadiran Tuhan di kalangan kami. Sememangnya Tuhan mengumumkan menerusi pengutusNya mengenai takdir Malaysia sebagai negara pelbagai kaum dan pemangkin kebangkitan semula di Asia Tenggara, Asia Pasifik dan negara di bawah segmen Golden Gate.”Golden Gate merujuk pintu masuk di timur Haram al-Sharif di Baitul Maqdis, yang menempatkan Masjid Al Aqsa.Baitul Maqdis yang kini di bawah pemerintahan Israel, merupakan tanah suci 3 agama iaitu Islam, Kristian dan Yahudi.Acara di Melaka itu juga menerima kerjasama sebuah kumpulan berpengkalan di Petaling Jaya bernama “Elim Freedom” yang turut mengutamakan peranan Baitul Maqdis, di samping Jerusalem House Of Prayer For All Nations (JHOPFAN).JHOPFAN merupakan pertubuhan berpengkalan di Israel diasaskan Tom Hess, seorang pastor warga Amerika Syarikat.Nasrudin menyifatkan penganjuran acara di Melaka itu satu bentuk provokasi untuk mencabar sensitiviti umat Islam Malaysia.“Sejarah luka penderitaan ummat Islam angkara kekejaman Israel tidak mungkin boleh dilupakan. Kini, sengaja dicetus provokasi melampau terhadap ummat Islam dengan menganjurkan Jerusalem’s Jubilee di bumi Malaysia.“Budaya Yahudi ini tidak selayaknya dibenarkan bertapak di atas tanahair kita. Kerajaan perlu tegas bertindak. Jangan cabar sensitiviti umat Islam. Jangan cemarkan tanah melayu ini dengan aktiviti Kristian Zionis ini,” katanya.sos"

It's the preferred burial place for Orthodox Jews, because it had direct access to the Golden Gate (a major entrance to Jerusalem). Religious myths state that when the Messiah comes, he will lead the worthy through the gate... so in the 16th century the Muslims walled up the Golden Gate. Though one might argue that if the Messiah had the power to raise the dead, he could probably break the wall too... which is why the Muslims also placed a cemetery in front where the gate used to be, so that they too will rise up and fight the Jewish zombies.So, yeah... religion..."
