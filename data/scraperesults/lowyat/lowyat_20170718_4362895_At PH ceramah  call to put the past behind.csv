Let’s move on,” implored Dr Mahathir.The two were nicknames PKR, DAP and Amanah supporters once used for Dr Mahathir, whose 22-year rule was defined by clampdowns on political dissent.About two weeks ago, Dr Mahathir mended fences with another arch-nemesis, PKR de facto leader Anwar Ibrahim.In 1999, after being fired from Dr Mahathir’s cabinet, Anwar was jailed on charges of abuse of power, allegedly on instructions from the top.Now, both share the responsibility of leading PH.Mat Sabu said he could not have imagined that he would one day, be invited to join Dr Mahathir on a private jet.He had been detained under the Op Lalang dragnet against civil society and political activists in 1987, when Dr Mahathir was prime minister.“When I meet people now, they don’t ask me when are the elections. They just give me the thumbs-up,” Mat Sabu said, referring to how PH’s new line-up has made the coalition an attractive alternative again to the ruling Barisan Nasional.The line-up is necessary for PH to register itself to enable it to go into the next general election with a common flag and logo.Analysts have said this was critical if PH is to present itself as viable alternative to BN.The mending of fences appeared to resonate with PH activists, who say they’ve been waiting for their leaders to come together despite their difficult histories.“Anwar himself was an Umno member, but he came out to fight the system,” said Petaling Jaya Utara Amanah activist Raja Firdaus Raja Shaffiq.“So if Anwar is reconciled with Dr Mahathir, and Dr Mahathir has admitted to some of his mistakes, then I don’t see why we should shun him.”Raja Firdaus, who took part in the first Reformasi protests against Dr Mahathir said he accepted the latter’s presence in PH.Another PH activist Zul A. Talib said he accepted Dr Mahathir’s transformation from foe to friend.“What we don’t like is tyranny, abuse of power and financial scandals. If the current deputy prime minster (Ahmad Zahid Hamadi) were to join us, I, too, would support him.” – July 18, 2017."
