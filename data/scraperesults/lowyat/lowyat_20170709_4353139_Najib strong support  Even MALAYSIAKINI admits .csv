EVEN ANTI GOVT MALAYSIAKINI FALL UNDER HIS MIGHT!https://m.malaysiakini.com/news/387958The presence of more than 70,000 visitors from various communities at the Hari Raya open house organised by Najib Abdul Razak and wife Rosmah Mansor here today, proves that support for the Barisan Nasional government led by the Prime Minister remains strong and intact, according to the event's organiser, Abu Bakar Harun.He said visitors began arriving at the Taman Tasik Sultan Abu Bakar as early as 8am, two hours before the event was planned to begin.""They not only came from around Pekan and Kuantan, but also from the federal capital as well as other states. They said they had come in support of the prime minister and to thank him.Editor's Pick How Najib’s strategic planning has backfired""They also said the prime minister had made various efforts in leading the government to help the people, and by announcing good news after good news in the form of aid and assistance,"" he told Bernama when met at the event here, today.The ceremony, which has been Najib's annual tradition as Pekan MP was also attended by Pahang Regent Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, accompanied by Pahang Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Adnan Yaakob.Huazong joins festivitiesMeanwhile, Federation of Chinese Associations Malaysia (Huazong) president Pheng Yin Huah said he took off from his business today to head to Pekan for Najib's open house.""I have not come alone, but in a group with association members from all over Pahang. We must come out in support for Najib because we are all Pahang people.""We are also confident with the prime minister's leadership in maintaining the country's economy. He has taken care of and given a lot of help as well as opportunities to businessmen from all communities. That is why we support him,"" he said.Meanwhile, a visitor, Mohd Zainal Isa, 37, said he left his home in Kuantan early for the event, as he had expected there would be a huge crowd with difficulty finding a parking space.Despite the minor inconvenience, Mohd Zainal said he refused to miss the opportunity to meet the country's leader in person, as it would be difficult to get it elsewhere.""I do not regret coming here at all, as the atmosphere is very lively with people from all walks of life, and I was happy to have the opportunity to shake hands with the prime minister.""It was worth it for me to come early because I could be at the front where the prime minister was to pass. There were also many types of dishes served, and I was spoilt for choice as to which dish to try first,"" he said.Racial harmonySuriana Zahri, 47, of Rompin said this was the first time she had been to the prime minister's open house, and described the atmosphere as festive, unlike a typical open house event.She said above all, she was excited to see leaders, dignitaries and artistes present at the event.Pekan native Hah Foong Moi, 63, said Najib's hospitality had captivated her family to support the premier's event each year.""Every year, this event will be filled with people. Hopefully, the friendly relationship between the leaders and the people we see today is maintained, and racial harmony, which has always been prioritised, remains intact and strong"" she said.Visitors were treated to more than 200 special dishes including laksa Pahang, ""opor daging"", rendang, ketupat, and ""patin masak tempoyak"", as well as entertained by local artistes Ara, Caliph Buskers, Ameng and Nash."
