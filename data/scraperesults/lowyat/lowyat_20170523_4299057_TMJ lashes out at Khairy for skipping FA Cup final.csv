That was more than enough to grace the match without the minister. Is the minister's presence compulsary? Surely not.You can't have the minister to be at all event, and not just football. Football is just one of many sports and there are also countless other youth activities throughout the country. For lashing out such statement, will the president also present at all final of football competition under FAM such as futsal, women's football and Liga Bolasepak Rakyat?"
