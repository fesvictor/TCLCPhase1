He said the move was being taken to ensure stability of the domestic oil industry and that the ministry would be holding a meeting with oil industry players next week to discuss the formula.  ""The people must sympathise with petrol station operators who suffer losses when oil prices drop. They (petrol station operators) feel they are the victims (when prices drop),"" he told reporters after attending a Ramadan function here Friday.  He added that he would be asking the Government to assist petrol station operators as they had been badly affected by the uncertainty in oil prices.The retail prices of petrol and diesel have been on a downward trend lately.Since April 1, the retail price of RON95, RON 97 and diesel are set on a weekly basis.It was previously on a monthly basis which was based on the managed float system. - BernamaAgain?

Therefore they are able to fix whatever price based on their cost of acquiring bulk petrol. Here, rate is fixed by govt. Let say their cost last week was RM1.93 and they sold it at RM1.98 wth 5sen gain. By this wed, if the price dradtically drop to RM1.93, and they still having remaining fuel at rm1.93...surely they gonna suffered!
