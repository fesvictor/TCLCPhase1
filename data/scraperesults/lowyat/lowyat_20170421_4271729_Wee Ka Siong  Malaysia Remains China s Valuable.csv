I would say the expansion of ports, railway, or even big buildings built by China, will nake a financial impact on our country as well.”On another matter, Dr Wee also urged local small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to venture into e-commerce to expand their businesses.“SMEs contributed to 36% of our gross domestic product (GDP) last year.“The Government aims to increase it to 41% by 2020,” he said.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...051kLGHlmkAU.99"

We take note of the concern but the ministry will not make it a precedent. We will control it through licences or other mechanism so it will not affect national security,” he said....“In our view, foreigners own about 80% of Singapore’s energy sector, so it should not be a problem,”"
