But rather, it is to enhance and complement the roles of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and other ministers,"" said Dr Ahmad Zahid on Wednesday at a joint press conference with Hishammuddin at his office here.Defence Minister Hishammuddin, who was appointed Special Functions Minister, made a courtesy call to Dr Ahmad Zahid — his first since he was given the new portfolio.Dr Ahmad Zahid, who is also Home Minister, said it was he who recommended Hishammuddin for the post to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak.""Today we discussed the various tasks that he has at hand, including tasks that are not related to defence.""I hope there won't be any more speculation on this appointment. A lot of the analysis out there has been far from the reality.""I believe the appointment will strengthen the Government and the party, and I will give my full support,"" said Dr Ahmad Zahid.Hishammuddin said it was important for both he and Dr Ahmad Zahid to meet and show that their relationship is solid.""We will prove this is not merely rhetorical. We have a very comfortable relationship with each other and I am looking forward to working with him under my new portfolio,"" said Hishammuddin.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...LzojygVHXWl1.99"
