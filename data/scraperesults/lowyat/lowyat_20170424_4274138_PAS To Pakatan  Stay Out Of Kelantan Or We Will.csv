When PAS seats are disturbed, we are free to stand anywhere, including in PKR seats, Amanah seats and anywhere Pakatan Harapan parties are standing.“I see a lot of disturbances, like the intention to ‘attack’ Kelantan and Amanah wanting to stand in Shah Alam. We will defend Shah Alam because it was won on a PAS ticket.”Tuan Ibrahim’s reminder comes just days before PAS is set to vote on a motion to cut ties with PKR at its muktamar (assembly) this Thursday.Meanwhile, discussions between PAS and Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) on a possible political pact have yet to yield any results.The opposition bloc wants PAS to enter GE14 with them to ensure one-to-one fights with the BN.But in a recent video that went viral, PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang said he wanted PAS to govern Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, Perak and Selangor, while leaving the other states to Umno.While stating that Kelantan and seats “traditionally” held by PAS be left alone, the Islamist party urged Pakatan to focus on other seats.“We hope our friends in Pakatan will concede PAS’ traditionally held seats. We have to focus on Umno seats.“Selangor PAS is ready to face GE14 anytime. PAS will mobilise our machinery in seats which can potentially be won.”Speculation is rife that PAS and Umno will form a political pact in GE14, which must be held next year.Yesterday, PAS Dewan Ulama information chief Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali called on the opposition bloc to avoid contesting in 80 parliamentary constituencies which PAS is eyeing.This is to avoid a three-cornered fight when PAS takes on Umno. Aside from the 80 parliamentary seats, PAS also hasn’t ruled out contesting in seats “traditionally” held by DAP and PKR.But PAS vice-president Idris Ahmad said the number of seats and areas where PAS would stand haven’t be finalised.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...ut-of-kelantan/"

Parrot,20170424,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 418,200704,From: Somewhere. Isolated from the rest of you pukes.,"Why would PH even contest there in the first place? It's PAS central. You're not going to win ultraconservatives there because they're way more unreasonable with anything but ultraconservative candidates. BA/PH had only won 1 to 2 out of 45 seats at most in the state legislative, and they're both insignificant districts (with barely any Wikipedia coverage). If PH is really dead set on winning northern peninsular votes they should drop Kelantan and focus on Terengganu, Kedah, Perlis and northern Perak instead. Perak especially.Not even UMNO can chip in enough to actually win the state. They can probably win some more by faking out their ultraconservative credentials or winning over disgruntled urban voters over by appearing like the less religiously-minded option (yeah, two-face campaigning is a thing), but never underestimate Kelantan's loyalty to PAS."

azhan82,20170424,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 240,201505,From: Klang Valley,Lel.. PAS seriously believes every other opposition party will just let them field candidates in 80 parliamentary seats ( up from 73 previously) and expect other parties to just sit quiet and accept it......PAS people are just jolok-ing the hornets nest and expect God to help them fight it Best Part : They are expecting everything would end well... Next GE gonna be a mess with BN swiping more seats at this rate....inb4 90 million can do wonders. Dont believe me? Ask JJPTR founder inb4 TAKBIR!
