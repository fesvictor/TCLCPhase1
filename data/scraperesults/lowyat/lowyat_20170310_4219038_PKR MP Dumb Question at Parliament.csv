We sure have dumb politicians on both sides of political divide. Sad."

pikachu01,20170310,Regular,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,418",200612,From: Penang,"The actual question was:That, at least, was the essence of an exchange in Parliament on Thursday, when Bayan Baru MP Sim Tze Tzin submitted a question asking the Home Minister how many foreign spies there were in Malaysia.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...sz25juSlXGZW.99It's a stupid reply instead of a stupid question."
fun_feng,20170310,One Cat to Rule Them ALL,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,666",200301,From: Stairway to Heaven,"Sim Tze Tzin ask ""How many foreign spies OPERATING in Malaysia... http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v7/sp/newss....php?id=1336480http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...-with-the-govt/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...id-tells-pkr-mpI think the only stupid answer is what we get from zahid, obviously Sim is asking on our intelligence gathering work here. If Zahid feels it's not appropriate to disclose the numbers, he can reply privately."

Lionel90,20170310,I lift! Or so I think..,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 824,201607,,"If this thread has any point, it is merely to show the problem with journalism nowadays, misleading title for clickbaiting.The essence of the question was like: ""how many foreign spies are there in the country, based on the intelligence""The answer was like: ""no info, since they wont declare themselves as such""It does go on to show that the intelligence network has failed. If anyone is stupid, it is the one who answers since he could easily pass it off as national security info.  And then there is another stupid who comes up with a completely misleading title.Mohon close thread, nthg to be discussed here.Edited: It has been moved from RWI."
pastacarbonara,20170310,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 37,201304,,I think it is a legitimate question. Zahid may or may not know but Malaysian intelligence would definitely have an answer. Just like how CIA found out that Russian Ambassador in the US is a spy.Though it may not be convenient to disclose in the interest of national safety but he has the right to ask and the people deserve to know.
Blofeld,20170310,Look at all my stars!!,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 2,445",201203,,"it's a simple valid question.but the person who answered gave a very silly answerworst of all, the thread starter did not read the news or he's unable to comprehend the simple language and as a result, gave a misleading title."

nintendo86,20170312,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 4,201509,,The stupid one is the one asking.. That kind of question you dont simply yell out at parliament where everyone including media is drooling for something worthy.. Its national secret and should be kept off from the world
mydurian,20170312,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 589,200509,"From: 25.0000° N, 71.0000° W",IPKR was mocking Zahid la.
Lionel90,20170312,I lift! Or so I think..,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 824,201607,,"I would say that it is a legitimate question. It is about whether our intelligence network has successfully carried out their duty or not, after all while the exact cost to taxpayers is unknown, u can bet it's not cheap.If it's not suitable to be disclosed, the answer can be as straight forward as that. But instead we have that type of clown-ish reply which is rather not too uncommon with our ministers, not sure if he was trying to troll or just plain dumb there, but the joke is on him; he didnt have to be captain obvious.His reply also went on to show that our intelligence network has failed. Now who is the stupid one? The one who accomplished his objective to highlight the failings, or the troll wanna be?"
nintendo86,20170312,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 4,201509,,Wow you serious bro? You ever heard other countries just simply disclose how many spies there are in their country? Only idiot ask that kind of question in broad daylight
Lionel90,20170312,I lift! Or so I think..,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 824,201607,,"U serious too? Of course we are, it's in serious kopitiam for a reason eh.Have u read the actual exchange? It's quite one thing to actually disclose it, but another to enquire about if the relevant agency has any info about the number of spies. Like i said, the title is completely misleadingOf course I wouldnt expect Zahid to come out and list out the number of spies from each country, that's dumbness on a whole new level. And then he didnt pass it off as a national security secret either, but said outright that the country doesnt have that info.   Is that not dumb?"
nintendo86,20170313,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 4,201509,,"of course zahid know the answer.. He,s the head of the safeness of our country.. Its just that the one who asked does not qualify for that kind of question"
pastacarbonara,20170313,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 37,201304,,"Likewise the rakyat has the right to ask and know the answer. If it's not convenient to disclose in the interest of national safety, just state so.There's no such thing as qualify or not qualify to ask."

Lionel90,20170313,I lift! Or so I think..,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 824,201607,,"I doubt u read the original exchange and came out with ur opinion based on ""that"" essence of exchange.http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...id-tells-pkr-mphttp://www.bernama.com/bernama/v7/sp/newss....php?id=1336480http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...-with-the-govt/TLDR: Zahid said we dont have the info, because of the infamous ""spies dont register themselves""He could easily pass it off as national security secret as we have agreed, couldnt he? Yet he blatantly says we have none.What other qualification a MP needs to ask regarding issues that the people might be interested in?"
pastacarbonara,20170313,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 37,201304,,On the basis of what? That the MP asking that question is not a peer of the DPM or because he is an opposition member?Politically immature?
