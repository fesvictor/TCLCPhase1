I want to ask how many of these money game schemes are from Penang.“Are they involved in any investment project with the state? What action have we taken to make sure that the state is not involved with these companies?” he asked.At this point, Speaker Datuk Law Choo Kiang allowed R.S.N. Rayer (DAP-Delima) to intervene.But when the assemblyman went on to talk about the possibility of Barisan Nasional politicians being involved in JJPTR, Choo Kiang cut him short.“I am giving you a warning. Don’t twist around when you get to ask a question,” he said.To Teh’s question, Danny said the state government was not involved in any project with such companies and urged anyone with details to lodge a police report.Teh then stood and told the Speaker: “It is clear that when the wrong platform answers our oral question, the response will be too general.“We hear of many Penang companies doing this such as MBI. I hope those who can answer the House will do so.”Datuk Shah Headan Ayoob Hussain Shah (BN-Teluk Bahang) also stood up and expressed his confusion.“Why is the tourism exco answering this question when it is an economic and finance issue? Why is this question not answered by the exco in charge?” he too asked.Choo Kiang then told Shah Headan that Lim had the power to delegate any exco member to answer questions on his behalf.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...sWR0x56rEJ50.99"
