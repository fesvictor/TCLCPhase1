We can cherish and promote the multi-religious characteristic of the Penang society where it has a hugely diverse community based on our common understanding and values.”He added that since Penang has a significant presentation of Christian, Tamil, Buddhist, Thai and Sikh communities, the state government should take the initiative to declare April 14 as a state holiday to show the state government’s recognition of its multi-cultural and multi-racial society with various communities living under the same roof.“CM Lim Guan Eng has also trumpeted that his government prioritizes the welfare and interest of Penangnites, now is the perfect time for him to show his commitment and appreciation to the diverse communities in the state.”Baljit pointed out that declaring a state holiday should not be an obstacle for Lim as under Section 9(1) of the Holidays Act 1951, the state authority by notification in the Gazette or in such manner as it thinks fit, appoint a day to be observed as a State public holiday in any such state.“Lim should use this prerogative to promote religious and cultural diversity in the state. It is to promote peace and harmony. It is also the common wish of Penangnites, we hope the DAP led state government will listen and act on it.”BALJIT SINGH is chairperson, Gerakan Central Bureau of Law and Human Rights-cum-coordinator of its Jelutong parliamentary constituency."
