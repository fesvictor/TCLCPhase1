ray123,20170624,Senior Citizen,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 2,450",200301,,"When you're revered enough, you don't need an official title. There is no doubt that PAS as a whole wants 'Islam #1' agenda as a whole, Nik Aziz did not oppose that. Yes, he was quite extreme at various points in PAS history (wanting age limits on snooker for example), but he was also a realist. He opposed UMNO's racial politics and later on (perhaps too late) he understood that defeating BN first should take priority. Only after sustained wins against BN could PAS could put a realistic plan for their Islamic vision.A reason most opposition supporters are sore at PAS now is because PAS has seemingly given up the idea of defeating UMNO. Rather, the new PAS is willing to go in bed with UMNO to get a bigger say in Malay politics. Just like how UMNO said they don't need the minorities, so is PAS saying that they don't need the opposition to influence Muslim policies anymore, especially since there are so many elements within UMNO who are using the religious tactics willingly."

clydefrog,20170624,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 22,201302,,PAS is the worst political party in Malaysia have no doubt about it. They are the Taliban and if given the chance they will ruin the country. They are a backward and regressive party with no goals apart from banning short skirts and spying on couples. Malaysia is at a crossroads now with petrol prices unlikely to hit the heights they did before we can no longer rely on Petronas to bail us out. The future progress of this country will be decided by the development of its people to compete in the knowledge based economy. This is simply a future where there is no place for parties like PAS which belong in the history books or in countries with no future like Afghanistan.

joe_mamak,20170625,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Would DAP give up its principles in order to prevent 3 sided contests in the next GE?  Answer is a clear no.  It would not remain in a coalition with a party  that pushes only its own agenda.  Besides that, lets not forget that PAS decided to sever ties with DAP but insisted on remaining in PR.  What sort of ""marriage"" is that?    The marriage was already on the rocks.  Better to quit.  IMO, all 3 parties had some blame in the break up of the marriage/coalition.  Screaming PAS might be in the same card with BN?  PAS does seem to share more commonalities with UMNO these days than to PKR and DAP.  You can't see that?  Yes, already divorced.  Marriage is over.  But now there is a new 3 party marriage.  Amanah, PKR and DAP.  All 3 share a common agenda.    If PAS shares the common agenda of these 3 parties and puts aside its own agenda, it is welcome to join the new coalition.  PAS shouldn't join this new coalition if it aims to purse its own agendas after utilizing the coalition to come into power.  The invitation was sent but it was not accepted.  So move on already.  Still want to score brownie points for what?"

They're the kingmaker because their seats added to either one side would've formed the majority in Pakatan.Not inviting someone to join a new coalition is not the same as kicking someone out of the existing coalition. It's not right to blame 1 out of 3 parties in the coalition, especially when it was PKR that triggered the break up via Langkah Kajang."

joe_mamak,20170625,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Yes, we all know it is in PAS' agenda.  But PR put forth their Buku Jingga and Hudud was not in Buku Jingga.  PR tried to reassure voters that their focus was on other more important and pertinent issues.  PAS leaders also did that but it must be noted that it came mostly from the Erdogans.  Other leaders chose to keep quiet."
Barbossa,20170626,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 225,201302,From: Black Pearl (FUCK JACK SPARROW STOLE MY SHIP),"Then they kicked PAS out and treated PAS as a pariah or an outcast. They tried to kill PAS by sponsoring a Team B to take on Hadi and when that failed they formed a new party called PAN or Amanah to rival PAS. They did everything short of employing a hit man to assassinate Hadi.sosIn other words, PAS said ‘we are still married to DAP and PKR’ while DAP said ‘no, we are already divorced’.This does not make sense. They closed down Pakatan Rakyat so that they can get rid of PAS. And then they formed Pakatan Harapan so that DAP’s new Islamic party, PAN, can replace PAS in the opposition coalition. And now they grumble that PAS does not want to be friends with Pakatan Harapan. This is totally illogical.The PAS ideology is ‘when the going gets tough, the tough get going’. The ideology of the Pakatuns and Dapsters, though, is ‘when the going gets tough, blame PAS’. The blame others syndrome has always been part of the DAP and Pakatan Harapan culture.sosDAP then formed Pakatan Harapan and sponsored and financed the formation of the PAS-splinter party, PAN (a.k.a. Amanah), to replace PAS in the new opposition coalition that PAS is excluded from. In short, DAP killed Pakatan Rakyat and tried to kill PAS and is still trying to kill PAS.sos"

Rpk did mention in his blog that he was the one who bring Hadi to TTDI and introduces Hadi to the crowd as a very good cleric. Ni wonder Rpk support Hadi kaw kaw because in a way, Hadi is his friend. It was all emotional things. Hadi being his friend, Anwar being his failed former boss, his sons who being prosecuted here. He doing all thses all for himself. Certainly not for us people.Sure dr M made many bad deeds in destroying this country but isn't it more important for us to stop jibby from destroying our nation further.  Etter for us to focus in the now than what happens bacj then. Stopping the cancer now is paramount. After that, we can judge them all ti the gallows."

Barbossa,20170626,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 225,201302,From: Black Pearl (FUCK JACK SPARROW STOLE MY SHIP),Kajang move was going to fail and the his highness sultan was going to reject WA as MB and choose Azmin instead.I can't predict that political game. Fucking riddles.
joe_mamak,20170626,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Can be predicted one.  Just a process of logical deduction and also a process of elimination. Kajang assemblyman stepped down.  Already there were rumours that Anwar was to stand with the aim of him becoming MB.  So, Khalid was targeted to go.  Anwar was facing prison.  You come to a what if he ends up in prison or not.  You predict for both cases.  If Anwar goes to prison, only very few candidates can stand in his place.  Either WA or his daughter.  Other candidates would be like WTF, he/she is not much different from the one who stepped down.  Why PKR put us through a by-election?  Between WA and his daughter, WA gets the nod.  It helps to be the poor waifu who stepped up for the husband who is in prison.  Next, the MB position.  Looking at the number of seats held by DAP and PKR, Khalid was shaky.  Which one is more acceptable?  Azmin lor.  PAS already pissed with Anwar.  Why would they support his wife?    If Anwar doesn't go to prison, he might still not get to be MB.  But can write another article lor."
