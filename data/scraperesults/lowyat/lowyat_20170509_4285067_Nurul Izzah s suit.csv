She is also asking for general damages and an injunction to restrain the defendants from publishing any defamatory words against her.In the statement of defence dated Dec 23, 2015, Khalid and Ismail Sabri said any injuries suffered by the plaintiff were due to her own actions in meeting Jacel Kiram, and that she had no right under the law to claim for aggravated damages and other forms of relief in the civil dispute.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...6YsSUP7dgAtR.99"
