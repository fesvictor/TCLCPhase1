It is a painful decision but we are left with no other choice,” he said, pointing out that Goh and him were the most vocal during ceramah to get the people to support PAS.“We are remorseful for having betrayed the voters,” he added.Sim said there was no right stewardship when working with Pakatan Rakyat or Pakatan Harapan, in which racism and bigotry were common.Hence, he said it would be pointless for them to stay on without a clear path in its struggles as the DAP had chosen to continue working with other (Opposition) parties with certain agendas.“So we decided to make a bold stand to quit the party in order not to lead the voters, especially the Chinese community, astray,” he said.On claims that they had quit due to resentment over losing the state party’s election, Sim said they could have quit last year but waited, hoping the party’s leadership would change and provide answers to some of their queries.“But there is no reply as to the stand of the party on PAS’ agenda and whether we need to support their campaigns,” he said.Sim also alleged that the party’s elections in November 2015, was “manipulated” by hidden hands from the headquarters.“Both Goh and myself received strong backing from the grassroots and could have won easily.“I don’t like to wash dirty linen in the public which is detrimental to the party,” he said.Sim added that no efforts were made to reconcile factions and quell infighting in the party.Goh, Lim and Chin also said that their reasons for quitting were similar."
