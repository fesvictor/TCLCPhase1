The chairman of the Gabungan Gerakan Merah Malaysia (GNGMM) announced his resignation after he was released from police custody at the Ampang Jaya District Police Headquarters at about 7pm. A 1.21-minute video recording of the announcement of his resignation was posted on his official Facebook account last night. Last Thursday, Jamal was arrested at his house and remanded for five days beginning Friday, to assist in investigations into raids he conducted on several gambling premises in Selangor. In December last year, Jamal and several others raided several premises in Ampang, Selangor, where gambling activities were purportedly held. - BERNAMA Read More : http://www.nst.com.my/news/2017/02/210235/...besar-umno-head"
