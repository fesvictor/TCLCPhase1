It lost the Teluk Intan seat at a by-election in 2014.Citing an example, Liow said the Opposition, particularly the DAP, was carrying tales that Malaysians would be adversely affected by the huge investments coming in from China.“They are instilling fear that locals may lose out to the Chinese investors and that the MCA has become rudderless and was a Chinese agent.“This is despite knowing that the Malaysian government always puts the interest of locals first, such as when sourcing for materials although the project may be carried out by a foreigner,” Liow said, adding that it was possible to get China to make huge investments here as both countries enjoyed good ties.Johor DAP chief and Kluang MP Liew Chin Tong recently mocked MCA’s role in bringing in investments from China and had asked if MCA was China’s agent as it had set up a PRC Affairs Committee and MCA Belt and Road Centre.Liow said apart from making unsubstantiated claims, the DAP also practised “divisive and negative” politics. “These included making claims that Malaysia is a failed state.”Liow said the MCA always fought for the Chinese community, making sure Malaysia remained moderate and peaceful.At the opening, Liow said all MCA divisions had been directed to activate their operation centres.“Wherever possible, we will try and open more than one centre to better serve the people,” he said."

Which chinese dare to voice out in the May 13 aftermath?Every chinese was fearful of another incident.MC tactic of trying to slam DAP for pretty much everything only begin after 2008 election (post-badawi) when DAP won Penang from Gerakan."

I also am not sure if your observations that they are gaining traction is correct or not.  My observation is different from yours.  I don't know but your use of the word we as in since we started suggests something else.  What started?

AI was a super right wing ultra malay islamist isis boi when he first joined BN. its some good reading if you are interested.Theres some relativeness to it, compared to the behemoth BN, PAS and DAP's numbers are still relatively small, so ""not that big an issue"" is quite accurate in a way, but then so would any opposition movement for most parts of our history. Damn life would be soo boring if niggas cant call themselves niggas and chinks cant call themselves chongs."

I think we need to go look up what sort of campaigning MCA ran on in those early days.  I don't believe it was PAS or Hudud.  Life is just fine without use of derogatory terms.  I don't know how many Chinese refer to other Chinese as chinks chongs.  But I think it is a very small minority.  Again, I suppose it depends on who you talk to."
