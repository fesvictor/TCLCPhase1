Confirming this, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said that Malaysia, however, is not the only country in which the controversial Muslim preacher resides.“Zakir Naik has a Malaysian PR but he is not a citizen, and he stays in other countries, I reckon,” he told the media on Tuesday. In November 2016, the Home Ministry denied Indian media reports that the televangelist had been granted Malaysian citizenship as a “package deal” when he was given the Tokoh Maal Hijrah award here in 2013.Dr Ahmad Zahid, who is also the Home Minister, said that while there was no basis for Malaysian authorities to initiate an investigation into Dr Zakir, they would render assistance to Indian authorities if both countries have a mutual legal assistance agreement.On April 15, the Hindustan Times reported that the Indian enforcement directorate had filed a charge sheet against Aamir Gazdar, a confidante of Dr Zakir, and Dr Zakir’s company Harmony Media Ltd, for allegedly laundering money on his behalf. The 1,000-page charge sheet lists Dr Zakir as an accused in the case.The Times of India has also reported that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) will seek an Interpol “red corner notice” against Dr Zakir to curb his movements outside Saudi Arabia if he fails to turn up for questioning.A red corner notice is an international arrest warrant circulated by Interpol on behalf of a government. This came after the televangelist defied repeated summonses.sos"

But some of his ideas can be used here; that’s why he was awarded the Tokoh Maal Hijrah award,” he said yesterday.The Hindustan Times in India, quoting an unnamed representative of Zakir, reported that Malay­sian citizenship was offered as a “package deal” when he was given the award here in 2013.The paper also said Zakir was hiding in Malaysia after his Islamic Research Foundation was recently banned by Indian authorities.Asked whether action would be taken against the Hindustan Times for the article, Nur Jazlan said no.“The Hindustan Times is a foreign newspaper,” he said.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016...3YvrzTwR6630.99"
Zeliard,20170418,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 146,200809,,"Monday, 28 November 2016 | MYT 10:40 AMZakir Naik mocks Indian media, denies given Malaysian citizenship PETALING JAYA: Controversial Muslim preacher Dr Zakir Naik (pic) mocked the Indian media, saying that he was never granted a Malaysian citizenship. The well-known televangelist, whose Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) has been banned in India, chided the media for creating the rumour when they previously claimed that he had been banned in Malaysia.  “Not true at all,” Zakir’s spokesman Arif Malik was quoted as saying by Indian news portal Janta Ka Reporter on Sunday. “Till a few months ago, the Indian media had been saying I was banned in Malaysia, and now they’re saying I’ve got Malaysian citizenship. That’s ridiculous. And there’s no truth in the Malaysian citizenship rumour,” Malik said, quoting Zakir's exact words. A Hindustan Times report on Saturday alleged that Zakir, who is under probe by India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA), was currently hiding in Malaysia and had been given citizenship by the local authorities. He was earlier suspected of being in Africa or Thailand. Quoting an unnamed representative of the religious scholar, the publication said he was offered the citizenship as a package deal when he was awarded the Tokoh Maal Hijrah award back in 2013. Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed has since denied the report, saying that Malaysia did not grant automatic citizenship to anyone unless they were born in the country to Malaysian parents. The Pulai MP also said that applying to become a citizen was a lengthy process and he did not think Zakir would want to apply to become a naturalised citizen. NIA officials have in recent days conducted raids at several commercial and residential properties owned by Zakir, and have seized several documents which allegedly indicated that the IRF had sponsored a would-be terrorist planning to travel to Syria to fight for the Islamic State.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016...lWzBCo1TbVlD.99"
