Sit down and recite religious verses.""He unveils the flaws of the present leaders, don't forget we also used to cover his flaws. Don't let it be our turn to show his shame and ‘scabs'. There is so much that we can reveal.“He (Mahathir) was strong (during his tenure) not because of him but because Umno members strongly supported him,"" he said.Dr Ahmad Zahid, who is Umno vice-president carrying out the duties of party deputy president, also touched on Dr Mahathir's U-turn by supporting Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.“Now only he wants to do a  'kona baring' (very sharp cornering manoeuvre). In the past, he accused Anwar of a lot of things, but now says Anwar was wronged due to differing political opinions,"" he said. - Bernamahttp://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...IvLvJi0PcsZF.99"

During DrM time, they all behave like little pussies.Not saying DrM is perfect , he is a politician also.But when you watch these soap opera amongst these politicians and you read these stupid comments by these juniors , you can see who are the masters of the game and who are the wannabes, small fries, kacang puteh, rabble rouser. For all his flaws, DrM is a master of the game and these juniors are still in their diapers."

You see if Mahathir come back into power and Ah Jib became the outcast, all these doggie will start barking at Ah Jib. That's the life of a doggie"
