Fortunately we have enough cash for the withdrawals,” Jamil was reported as saying yesterday.Last April, Rafizi pleaded not guilty to charges of criminal defamation, for allegedly defaming Tabung Haji, on February 18 in his blog.The punishment for defamation is a maximum two years’ jail or a fine or both.Previously, Rafizi had claimed Tabung Haji’s reserves suffered a deficit for two consecutive years.Rafizi said that Tabung Haji hasn’t yet given a satisfactory answer to his exposes on its financial losses.“If the upcoming exposes are not answered honestly and sincerely, more depositors will withdraw their funds from Tabung Haji because they will lose more trust in the management who are seen as political pawns.”Rafizi added that his case would go to trial in May.“I will call on many witnesses, including former Bank Negara governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz, who first reminded Tabung Haji that its reserves were in the negative.” http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...pose-next-week/"
