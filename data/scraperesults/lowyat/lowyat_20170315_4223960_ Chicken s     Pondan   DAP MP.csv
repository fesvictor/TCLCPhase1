TDM has been in politics equally as long as LKS, only that 23 years he was PM, before that he was also normal MP, deputy minister, minister, deputy prime minister etc.in fact Malaysian including annuar musa mudah lupa, in 1999 LKS lost his parliament seat in bukit bendera....even TDM once lost his Alor star (kot Star) MP seat in 1969...."

Faidzal,20170315,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 234,200808,From: From JB to KL!,I was referring to annuar musa.tan sri annuar musa is the ketua penerangan umno (umno info chief).so that's what I was referring to.BN spin media is under annuar musa.if you watch the clip annuar musa was mentioning all these politicians with long careers.that's why I remarked that why claim TDM was only 23 years?when he was active as long as LKS since the 1960s.and the fact that LKS had 5 years of not being an MP bcos he lost election in 1999.and that LKS was only leader of DAP party around 1990s and above and not since 1960s like many BN media would like you to believe.
