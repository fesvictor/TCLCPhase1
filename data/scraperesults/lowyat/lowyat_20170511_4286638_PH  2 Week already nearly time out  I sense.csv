When we wanted to register Adil back then, until today it has not been approved,” she said.Adil was the original party Wan Azizah had wanted to register before PKR.In case ROS denies PH’s registration, Wan Azizah said the various parties will use their own logos for GE14.PS: When Parti ""Adil"" was rejected by RoS, they then change the name to  to Parti ""Keadilan"" and was Accepted by RoS. For PH case, they will just tried it only ONCE...yup ONCE and then give-up. While the PH logo looked like being designed by Ahmad Maslan. They are obviously not serious and insincere in wanting to win the next GE.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...ros-in-2-weeks/"

Michael2020,20170516,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 12,201011,From: Bora-bora Island,"If PH lost again, the co-called ""Relaxing"" PR supporter will blame everyone from Najib to Banglas.....except their beloved party who are exerting a half-hearted effort to win the GE. The supporter will just sweep away the issue and claimed it is just a small issue and will not effect the outcome of the GE. PH don't really want to win the next GE and only the blind can't see it."
joe_mamak,20170516,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"I don't think so.  Some of the allegations floating around during the GE are not true.  But some appeared to be.  I really don't think it is such a big issue.  And it really won't affect the outcome of the GE.  But you want to think otherwise, up to you."
