If he was doing a great job, he would have reformed all the crap that enabled corruption that Dr M started.Instead, he took advantage of the same system himself. Sure, his legacy isn't anywhere near as bad as Dr. M yet because he hasn't been running the country for as long...BUT...Dr. M at least also brought some progress. Jibby hasn't...not really...All of us had such high hopes with Pak Lah but he turned out to be epic fail.And some idiots still want us to vote BN."
