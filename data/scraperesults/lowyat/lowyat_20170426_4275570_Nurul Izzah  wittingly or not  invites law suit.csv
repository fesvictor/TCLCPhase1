Raja Sara understands that every Malaysian, like the three generations of her family before her, must do their bit for Malaysia. Although she was from what can be considered as an elite family, she empathises with the difficulties most Malaysians have to endure in their daily lives."

As much as I hate GST, opposition should not abolish it. Otherwise it is like dumping the millions of money spent to the ocean. Perhaps opposition can offer the first few years at 0%."
