How many 'new' chinese schools did we have for the past 20 years? Have you done ANY research on the matter?As for Michael Chong, tough luck, if he wanna help people for the sake of helping people, sure, he'll go on, else if he's helping others to stay in power, fuck him too.4.

Because Chinese under Pakatan will definitely be treated better than under MCA. Anyway, its time to say goodbye to Chinese schools in favour of general uplifting of education standard in the whole country, DZ society has become super-political already... Besides, you think MCA do all this for protection of Chinese? Bollocks. They accept all the tsunami cina babi cina etc comments in order for their own selves to get government contracts. You know who's in charge of bangla importation and registration? MCA guy. Bumi quotas and policies? Approved by MCA. What do you call that if not selling out Chinese?"

Yamma,20170105,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 710,201206,,"MCA loyal man continues to resolve problems for those seeking help THE waiting area outside the MCA Public Services and Complaints Department is never empty.There is always someone there with a sad story to tell or in need of a helping hand.Luckily, they are able to get help here at the department headed by Datuk Seri Michael Chong.“I have been here for the last 26 years and solved more than 35,000 cases. I keep a record on all cases, handwritten until 10 years ago, when we switched to using computers,” he said. Known for his press conferences highlighting various social problems, Chong said the key to his success in solving cases was the strong teamwork within MCA and rapport with the other parties within the coalition.“On my own, I will be as helpless as anyone. Teamwork and connections helps a lot in resolving the problems,” he said, adding that access to the right people in the right places helped expedite many cases.Chong himself was “saved” by the department in his youth.“I come from a poor family and have six younger siblings. In 1974, I moved from my hometown in Batu Arang to Petaling Jaya looking for work,” he said.Chong added that his salary when working in his hometown was not enough to make ends meet.After various jobs, he finally applied to work in MCA in 1980, though he had already been a member for nine years by then.He worked as a personal assistant for Tan Sri (then Datuk) Lee Kim Sai, and though his handicap — he did not understand Mandarin — was eventually exposed, he was allowed to keep his job.However, not understanding Mandarin came back to haunt Chong when Lee was made a deputy minister and needed an assistant with good language skills.“I ended up in a general administration job but every now and then I would be asked to help take care of people who come to the party for help, with issues like rubbish collection and blocked drains,” he said.Chong eventually took on bigger cases as the years passed and is now the man to see for help, especially in serious cases involving ah long, scams and pimps.“I try to solve all the cases that come here. At the very least, I will provide them with an answer, even if the problem is one that cannot be resolved,” he said.Chong, who is infamous for telling members of the media that he is retiring, said he actually tendered his resignation in 2008.“Everything was chaotic at that point and I decided to stay on as I felt the party needed my support and I could help by helping more people,” he said.Chong, who will be 65 years old this year, said he derived great satisfaction from helping others.“My family and I received a lot of help when I was younger.“Neighbours would donate things to us. We only enjoyed a good meal when my mother, who worked part-time as a dishwasher, would bring home leftover food after a big event,” he said.Chong said MCA had never turned away those who sought help, including those who supported the Opposition.He urged the Chinese community to back Barisan in the general election.“Help Barisan, including MCA, so we have a voice in the Government,” he said, pointing out that the Malay and Indian votes were with Barisan.He said MCA had a good track record of serving the community, adding that he feared the Chinese may vote themselves out of the Federal Government if they continued to be hoodwinked into believing that Pakatan will form the next Federal Government.Chong said the fact that most DAP leaders contested both state and federal seats showed that they were not convinced Pakatan will form the Federal Government. http://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2...e-seeking-help/DAP did help solve problem rather than making political statement?"
