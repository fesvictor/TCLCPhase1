kevin23,"  Jul 11 2017, 09:24 AM",Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 714,Joined: Oct 2007,,The seats are not that cramped la jokers. All probably havent sat before yet saying seats are cramped. I am big size yet i find the seats decent. Plus they are using a bigger plane for the longer routes. So theres more than enough legroom . Dont compare with those small planes u guys take to fly to langkawi la. I flew to Tokyo on AA and it was comfortable enought for me. I can say the legroom is on par if not better than MAS.

If not working then susah a bit.Legroom is ok, but no way better than mas la. Still the difference is not that much or as bad as what some ktards say.Duduk office everyday also not say every office got ergonomic seats la. Your chance of getting back problem from sitting at work is higher. How often does a person takes flights anyways, even most frequent flyers also once or twice a month la. No need to over exaggerate la."
