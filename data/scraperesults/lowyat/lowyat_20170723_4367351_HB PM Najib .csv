However, 1MDB has reportedly incurred debts of MYR 42 billion (about USD 11.1 billion) after only six years of operations, prompting a negative outlook on the country's economic growth.[98]On 2 July 2015, The Wall Street Journal ran an exposé alleging that MYR 2.672 billion (USD 700 million) had been channelled from 1MDB into Najib's personal bank accounts, triggering widespread calls for his resignation.[99][100][101] Najib has denied any wrongdoing and has announced plans to sue the newspaper for libel.[102] On 6 July 2015, amid the 1MDB scandal, the ringgit fell to 3.8050 against the US dollar, the first time it slid beyond the 3.80 currency peg, which was lifted in 2005.[103] To back up the allegations, on 7 July 2015, The Wall Street Journal released a batch of partially redacted documents that purportedly show how nearly US$700 million (RM2.6 billion) was moved from 1MDB into Najib's personal bank accounts. These documents relate to transactions in March 2013, December 2014 and February 2015.[104]The multi-agency task force investigating these allegations reported on 10 July 2015 that Najib's bank accounts at AmBank Islamic were closed before The Wall Street Journal reported the transfers of billions of ringgit to those accounts thereby confirming that Najib had two accounts at that bank. The task force also confirmed that the six accounts it had just frozen did not belong to Najib but did not name the holders of those accounts [105] Najib's handling of the corruption scandal was criticised by, among others, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and then Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin. During Najib's mid-term Cabinet reshuffle on 28 July 2015, Najib dropped Muhyiddin from his position as Deputy Prime Minister, as well as other Ministers who had been critical of his leadership. Najib stated that the reason for this was to create a more ""unified team"".[106]On 1 August 2015, Najib addressed UMNO delegates in Seremban and in a clear reference to the Sarawak Report, the London-based whistleblower site founded and operated by journalist Clare Rewcastle-Brown, demanded that “white people” stay out of Malaysia’s affairs and stressed that he valued loyalty above all, and not smart people.[107]On 3 August 2015, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission stated that the RM 2.6 billion that had been banked into Najib's personal account came from donors, not 1MDB, but did not elaborate on who the donors were or why the funds were transferred, nor why this explanation had taken so long to emerge since the allegations were first made on 2 July 2015.[108][109] Umno Kuantan division chief Wan Adnan Wan Mamat later claimed that the RM 2.6 billion is from Saudi Arabia as thanks for fighting ISIS. He further claimed that the Muslim community in the Philippines as well as southern Thailand had also received similar donations, and that since the donations were made to Najib personally as opposed to UMNO, the funds were deposited into Najib's personal accounts.[110]The scandal took a dramatic twist on 28 August 2015 when a member of Najib's own party, Anina Saaduddin, UMNO’s Langkawi Wanita (women's) representative, filed a civil suit against him alleging a breach of duties as trustee and that he defrauded party members by failing to disclose receipt of the donated funds, and account for their use. This suit was filed in the Kuala Lumpur High Court and also named party Executive Secretary Abdul Rauf Yusof. Expressing fear that Najib would wield influence to remove any member of UMNO ""for the sole purpose of avoiding liability"" the court was also being moved for an injunction to restrain UMNO, its Supreme Council, state liaison body, divisions and branches from removing the nominal plaintiff as a party member pending the determination of the suit. The plaintiff is also seeking a repayment amounting to US$650 million, the amount allegedly deposited by Najib to a Singapore bank, an account of all monies that he had received in the form of donations, details of all monies in the AmPrivate Banking Account No 2112022009694 allegedly belonging to Najib, along with damages, costs, and other reliefs.[111]On 21 September 2015, the New York Times reported that US investigators were investigating allegations of corruption involving Najib as well as people close to him. In particular, investigators were focused on properties in the United States that were purchased in recent years by shell companies owned by Najib's stepson Riza Aziz or connected to a close family friend, as well as a $681 million payment made to what is believed to be Najib’s personal bank account.[112]The claimed MYR 2.6 billion ""donation"" into Najib's personal accounts led the opposition to table a no-confidence motion against Najib, on 18 October 2015.[113]On 26 January 2016, Malaysia's Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali announced that the investigation into the $681 million payment into Najib's personal bank account had been closed. The Anti-Corruption Commission investigating the gift, led by Apandi, concluded that no laws had been broken and that the gift did not amount to graft. Apandi was appointed attorney general by Najib in August 2015 after the previous attorney general, Abdul Gani Patail, was abruptly dismissed by Najib. Although Bernama, Malaysia's state-run news service, reported that Abdul Gani was removed for health reasons many speculated that his dismissal was related to the 1MDB corruption investigation.[114] The Attorney General then said that the [Saudi Royal Family] was the source of the $681 million gift,[115] although doubts remain as the Saudi ministries of foreign affairs and finance had no information on said gift.[116]The previously unidentified investor [117] Najib was reported to have returned $620 million to the Saudi royal family in 2013, but no explanation was given as to the reason for the investment or what happened to the $61 million Najib did not return.[118] Najib hailed the results of the investigation and reiterated his denial of any wrongdoing.On 28 March 2016, the Australian television programme Four Corners in an episode called State of Fear: Murder and Money in Malaysia,[119] aired new allegations about the large sums of money that have flowed into the bank accounts of Najib Razak.On 30 March 2016, the Wall Street Journal, Time and several other news agencies reported that Prime Minister Najib Razak and his wife, Rosmah Mansor had spent $15 million on luxury goods and extravagant travel expenses.[120] During Najib Razak's golf diplomacy with U.S. President Barack Obama on 24 December 2014, Malaysian investigation documents show that Rosmah Mansor had purchased items amounting to $130,625 at a Chanel store in Honolulu, Hawaii. The allegation was confirmed when a store employee at the Chanel store in the upscale Ala Moana Center recalls Mr. Najib’s wife shopping there just before 25 December 2014.[121]In April 2016, Mohd Nazifuddin Najib, the son of Najib Razak, has been named in the Panama Papers.[122]In July 2016, the United States Department of Justice launched a lawsuit to seize American assets worth over 1 billion USD (4.1 billion MYR) allegedly obtained from 3.5 billion USD (14.38 billion MYR) of misappropriated 1MDB funds. Within the lawsuit, a government official of high rank who had control over 1MDB was referred to as ""Malaysian Official 1"", and mentioned over 30 times. ""Malaysian Official 1"" was alleged to have received around 681 million USD (2.797 billion MYR) of stolen money from 1MDB while returning most of it. In September 2016, Najib was identified as ""Malaysian Official 1"" by Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department and the Barisan Nasional strategic communications director. Dahlan also claimed that Najib was not named because he was ""not part of this investigation"".[123][124]"
