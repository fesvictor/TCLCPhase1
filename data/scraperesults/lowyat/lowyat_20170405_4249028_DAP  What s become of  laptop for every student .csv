Firstly, the government needs to explain whether an open tender was conducted for the procurement of the Chromebooks.“Secondly, why do they cost so much? Thirdly, why were they purchased from YTL, which is not a computer hardware manufacturer, when it would be cheaper to procure them from manufacturers, such as Acer or Samsung?“Lastly, why did the government pay a premium price for additional services to YTL when the same company is already paid billions of ringgit to provide software and support services through the 1BestariNet project?” Zairil said about the controversial internet infrastructure and education technology project for schools.Zairil demanded an explanation from Putrajaya for the “ambitious election promise which degenerated into yet another profligate project for a company that already had a monopoly on internet infrastructure and education technology in the Malaysian education system”."
