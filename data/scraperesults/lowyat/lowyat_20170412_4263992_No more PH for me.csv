In order to get PH off, have to apply for it but depending on availability and manpower.Looks like double pay inkambing but I prefer off than more pay because health > wealth.inb4 14th floor.inb4 resign"

Carlo J,20170412,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 154,201003,From: Lurking in your backyard,I'll let my TL know about this but operations here doesn't stop at all so I don't think they're bothered about it.RM10k is probably small change to them.

darosha,20170412,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 382,200301,"From: UM, KL, PJ, 14",well if they didnt give you a break at all PH then this PH 24th April also no different. Doctors in hospital also dont have a break during PH so its no just your problem. Now doctor dont get oncall claim also for that.

joe_mamak,20170412,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,Refer to your terms of employment.  Also refer to the Employment Act.  But you probably don't come under it as you should earn more than the amount applicable under the act.  The Act does spell out the details about holidays.

It's true about the minimum no. of public holidays the company/client has to observe, that's why it's still under discussion regarding to global PH like Labour Day, Christmas, New Year.Yeah, but only double pay for that particular day, unlike my days in retail which I didn't mind working on a PH since we also get commission then.Hahaha...At least they observe those PH, for us it's still under discussion."
