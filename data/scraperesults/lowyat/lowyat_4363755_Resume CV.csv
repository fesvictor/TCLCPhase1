However, I believe I have done my part well because I constantly get complimented by my superiors.1) Customer Service - Appraisal -7/10- Frequently received compliments from customers. - Received compliments from HOD- Had loyal customers that would look for me instead of other CS agents when they had issues- Bosses from other dept wanted me to be transferred to their dept when I couldn't stand CS job anymore2) Marketing - Appraisal - 8/10- Frequently complimented by HOD/GM- Received compliments from clients- Received the most certificates for 'syok-sendiri' programme organised by my companyDespite all these, i have nothing to boast like what I see on internet how they have helped company earned xxxx money, successfully organised a project and yada yada. Besides that, is it ok for the resume to be 4 pages long?Kindly advise, thanks.PS: I know there's a thread to discuss about this topic but I'm posting here because there are more active members here."

Unless you are someone with over 10 years experience, 1-2 page is pretty normal.If you really have nothing to put under achievements, then just don't include that section. Nothing is worse than putting unrelated points that the employer won't care about."
