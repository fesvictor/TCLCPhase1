mlab88,20170408,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 5,200703,,"The affordable MPV segment is one that’s attracting plenty of interest, thanks to the January launch of the Honda BR-V, which has shot Honda to the top of a segment it previously wasn’t present in. The SUV-styled seven-seater enters a market that has the Toyota Sienta, Toyota Avanza and Nissan Grand Livina. Further down the price scale, local options include the Perodua Alza and the Proton Ertiga, launched last year.All the above bar the 1.6L Nissan have four-cylinder engines below 1,500 cc, and attract excise duty of 60%. That has now been increased by 5% to 65%, according to the “Excise Duties Order 2017” published by the attorney general’s chambers on March 31. This fresh order replaces the 2012 version and takes effect from April 1, 2017.Unlike import tax, excise duty is levied on all products, whether imported or manufactured locally. This means that the Honda BR-V, Toyota Sienta, Toyota Avanza, Perodua Alza and Proton Ertiga are affected by this move. Alcohol and cigarettes too, if you’re wondering about the increase in “sin tax”."
