This PIL-1 costs 140 per cent higher than it.""We are concerned th­at this huge RM7.5bil cost for just one 19.5km highway will eventually be borne by Penangites,"" he said in a statement today.Lee also challen­ged the state govern­ment to reveal the cost for reports for the RM7.5bil PIL-1 project as he claimed that the state gov­ernment has a habit of substantially overpaying consultancy costs.""It seems that Pakat­an's mega infrastruc­ture projects, espec­ially in Penang, cos­ts substantially hig­her than similar pro­jects by the federal government,"" he adde­d.https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/07/...ysia-claims-mca"
