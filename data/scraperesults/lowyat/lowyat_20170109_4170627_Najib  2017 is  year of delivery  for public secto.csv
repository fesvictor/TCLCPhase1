Pix by Asyraf HamzahPUTRAJAYA: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak today announced 2017 as the year of delivery for the public sector to serve the people and the country. He said the focus must be on delivery and if this could be done, 2017 could be a successful year for Malaysia. ""We have to implement projects, programmes and services that have been determined for the people and the country's wellbeing. ""This is the focus: delivery, delivery and delivery. ""The delivery is not only in terms of physical, but values as well,"" he said at the Prime Minister's Department monthly gathering. The prime minister also reminded government servants to protect the people's rights by not being involved in graft. ""We must never take what belongs to the people.
