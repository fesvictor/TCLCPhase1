Less pressure and fun. What industry do you think is making more money that you could support your living buying house and cars ? Some says F&B is good but too long hours , some says properties but too much stress. Work in entertainment park, is fun but pay is less.. etc etc.What will you choose if u have one last chance to make it right?"
