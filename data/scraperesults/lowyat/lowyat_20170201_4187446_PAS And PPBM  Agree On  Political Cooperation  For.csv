PAS was represented by Tuan Ibrahim while Mukhriz represented PPBM.PPBM has tried to lobby PAS in order to avoid three-cornered fights between opposition parties against Barisan Nasional (BN) in the next general election.After falling out with DAP, PAS quit Pakatan Rakyat last year and is mooting to form a third opposition bloc with other allies in order to contest in elections.http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...h.0MzRDyss.dpuf"
