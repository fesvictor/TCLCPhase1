darthboyzzee,20170413,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"Rafizi riuh sampai tak tahu dosa pahala, kata Nik AbduhKUALA LUMPUR: Ketua Pemuda PAS Pusat Nik Abduh Nik Abdul Aziz mengecam Rafizi Ramli hari ini kerana membuat tuduhan tidak berasas dan membesarkan-besarkan perkara kecil.Kenyataan itu dipercayai merujuk akuan bersumpah naib presiden PKR itu hari ini, yang mendakwa bekas timbalan presiden PAS Nasharudin Mat Isa menerima dana yang didakwa berkait 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).“Suka sangat menyelongkar sampai jadi hobi. Tahi ayam pun ‘digempaknya’ jadi tahi tuan ayam,” katanya di Facebook hari ini.“Betullah kata presiden PAS (Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang bahawa (Ahli Parlimen) Pandan ini tidak tahu dosa dan pahala.”Sebaik sidang Dewan Rakyat ditangguhkan dengan penuh kekecohan selepas pembentangan usul pindaan Akta Mahkamah Syariah (Bidang Kuasa Jenayah) 1965 6 April lalu, Rafizi membuat dakwaan ada “individu rapat” dengan pimpinan PAS menerima dana 1MDB.Abdul Hadi kemudian menafikan dakwaan Rafizi dan menyifatkannya “jahil dosa pahala” dan perlu bertaubat.Rafizi dalam akuan bersumpah hari ini mendakwa Nasharudin menerima wang yang didakwa daripada anak syarikat 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).Rafizi mendakwa dana tersebut pada awalnya disalurkan ke akaun peribadi Perdana Menteri Datuk Seri Najib Razak, dan kemudian, sejumlah wang disalurkan kepada Nasharudin.Menurut Rafizi, maklumat ini diberitahu kepadanya pada 28 Januari tahun ini, oleh seorang bekas pegawai kanan Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia (SPRM) yang pernah mengetuai siasatan ke atas 1MDB dan dakwaan pembabitan Najib dalam skandal itu.Menurut Rafizi, perkara sama diketahui Ketua Penerangan Dewan Ulama PAS Khairuddin Aman Razali.Nik Abduh berkata PAS juga menerima “banyak maklumat” tetapi tidak akan membuat tuduhan melulu tanpa bukti kukuh.“Mereka berusaha mempraktiskan akhlak mulia, sesuatu yang belum masak buktinya, maka diam adalah senjata disarung dan biarkan ia terlihat.“Nasihat saya (kepada Rafizi), pandu cermat jiwa selamat. Tekan minyak, tekan juga brek,” katanya.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...kata-nik-abduh/"

At the first DAP National Congress held in Setapak, Kuala Lumpur on 29 July 1967, the DAP declared itself to be ""irrevocably committed to the ideal of a free, democratic and socialist Malaysia, based on the principles of racial and religious equality, social and economic justice, and founded on the institution of parliamentary democracy"".[6]DAP"

Salah? Dia berunding dengan Amerika tak apa, berunding dengan negara asing tak apa, bincang tentang politik Malaysia,"" katanya di Rusila, Terengganu.Zulhazmi berkata Abdul Hadi juga perlu menyatakan bilakah rundingan pihak terbabit dengan AS bagi mengubah politik Malaysia dibuat.""Sebutlah dengan lidah yang fasih wahai Tuan Guru! Jangan mempolemikkan isu tanpa fakta dan bukti. Kemukakan bukti,"" katanya.Zulhazmi juga mengingatkan, Abdul Hadi pernah disaman oleh anggota PKR apabila beliau membuat kenyataan mengaitkan pihak tertentu dengan pil kuda menjelang pilihan raya umum 2013."

darthboyzzee,20170415,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"Raja Petra Kamarudin April 14 at 10:04pmQ1: Why make the revelation now, why didn’t you correct the media reports soon after your SD came out two years ago?Actually the SD was signed 3 years ago, not 2 years ago. And it was published the very next day and I was arrested and charged almost immediately.I have been writing article upon article over the last 3 years saying that I did not make any allegation about Rosmah Mansor and the two Lt Kols husband and wife. What I said was that an informer had informed me about the matter. By the way, have you read my SD yet? I would suspect not, as many who comment do so without reading it. That is why you said 2 years instead of 3. Or else you would have known it was signed in June 2008.Anyway, is it my job to correct what the mainstream media intentionally distorts? And did anyone from the mainstream media talk to me? Most of the mainstream media actually covered my trials but still they misreported the whole thing.Are you saying I am to blame for the misdeeds and malicious acts of others? Their job is to whack me and that is what they did. Now, after 3 years of getting whacked, I am whacking back. Is this not my right?Anyway, the interview was done 2 months ago, not now. People ask me why now, just before the Sarawak elections?2 months ago there was no confirmation of the Sarawak elections. So when do I do it? After the Sarawak elections? Then, after the Sarawak elections, people will say why now, just before the 13th GE? So I wait until after the 13th GE and people will still ask, why now, just before a by-election?So when should I do it? After Malaysia bans elections?Q2: Can you comment on Din Merican’s denial that he was involved in the attempt to discredit Rosmah and Najib?Did I say he was involved? I just asked him to check with Anwar Ibrahim the background of Lt Kol Azmi Zainal Abidin and that was what he did. And he admitted this in his Blog posting. So what is the issue? Why accuse me of something I did not do?Q3: Aside from your Statutory Declaration, do you have any proof of the involvement of the people you mentioned in the attempt to discredit Najib and Rosmah?What do you mean by proof? Video recordings of them in towels in a hotel room? Define ‘proof’. Anwar was convicted and sentenced to 15 years jail in 1999 based on testimony. Testimony is proof and that was good enough to sentence Anwar to 15 years jail. My testimony is even better. It is in the form of an SD.Q4: Now talks on the ground is that your sudden revelation is because you want to return to Malaysia. Your comment?Talks on the ground is that Najib was caught kalwat in a Port Dickson hotel room. Do you want to ask Najib this? Who cares about talks on the ground? If the government says I am welcome back in Malaysia and I tell the government to go to hell because I love it in the country of my birth what then are you going to say?And what ‘sudden revelation’? Have you not heard what I said? I have been repeating this again and again over the last 3 years. What’s so sudden about saying the same thing over 3 years? You mean I kept silent the last 3 years and only today I am talking?Q5: You have also been accused of shifting attention from the Sarawak election with your latest allegation. Your thoughts.Shifting attention? You really must improve your communication skills because I don’t understand what you mean. I have also been accused of going to church every Sunday and that my wife and I have left Islam to become Catholics.Do you really think I care what they say? My interview was done before the announcement of the Sarawak elections. Maybe they held the Sarawak elections to shift attention from my interview since my interview came first.Q6: Where does your loyalty lie now that you have turned the tables against Anwar and the opposition front?You must be smoking something. Let me know what it is so that I can get some. My loyalty from Day One was always with the rakyat: dulu, kini dan selama-lamanya. Now, which part of the word rakyat don’t you understand?Raja Petra KamarudinMalaysia TodayQBslOyX8J4Qhttps://selvarajasomiah.wordpress.com/2011/...ry-declaration/"
