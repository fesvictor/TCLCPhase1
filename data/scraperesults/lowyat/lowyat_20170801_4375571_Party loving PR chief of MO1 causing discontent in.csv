That investment remains high, prompting many to wonder which Malaysians have so much money to pour into the UK when the economy appears so tight for most denizens of KL?Londoners, meanwhile, are increasingly frustrated that house prices and rents are being pushed up by people who see the capital as a place to park and grow their money, rather than a place to live and work.  It has become a bit of an issue.Sarawak Report has been alerted to one such conflict involving investments by the Prime Minister’s communications advisor, UK national Paul Stadlen, who has been financing the development of a number of flats across London from his base in KL.To be more accurate, he has invested in BLOCKS of flats, which at London prices command price tags of millions of pounds i.e. tens of millions of ringgit.Who is Stadlen?In June 2015 a parliamentary reply to a question on the matter stated that Paul Stadlen was not paid by the government. Yet, as the foreign press corps were fully aware, Mr Stadlen was still the person who handled their enquiries on behalf of the PM’s office and many of them had been handed this card, which matched his CV on LinkedIn, claiming he managed the Prime Minister’s communications:Sarawak Report in subsequent months received extensive information indicating that he remains a full-time advisor to the Prime Minister in terms of pronouncements and press releases, which until the 1MDB crisis exploded was his recognised position. There is no evidence that he has any other occupation in KL, although he is welcome to correct us.The statement that Stadlen is not paid prompted people to ask if he was acting as a volunteer in this sensitive public position or whether he was being funded by external sources – another anonymous Middle Eastern donor perhaps?Stadlen had first worked for Najib as boss of the KL office of the PR company APCO.  An acceptance letter to an apparent subsidiary of APCO named Mind Teams was issued by the Prime Minister’s office to Stadlen in 2009, stating an agreed US$420,000.00 for six months work.According to APCO’s US foreign agent registration forms, the duties included “develop[ing] messages for communication with US policy makers” and “map[ing] government official, think tanks, journalists, NGOs relevant to Malaysia-US relationship”. However, Sarawak Report has not been able to find Mind Teams Sdn Bhd even recorded in Malaysia’s company register.After the APCO contract became mired in controversy, linked to Malaysia’s extreme anti-Israel stance, the relationship was severed and Stadlen temporarily moved to work for FBC Media, which Sarawak Report later exposed in 2011 for accepting vast multi-million dollar contracts (RM84 million and RM15 million) from the Malaysian Prime Minister’s Office and State of Sarawak for illegally promoting Najib Razak, Taib Mahmud and various Malaysian government projects on mainstream TV news programmes for the BBC, CNBC and CNN, in violation of broadcast laws.FBC Media was axed by the broadcasters and the company closed, but Stadlen appears to have moved to work directly for the Prime Minister’s Office in much the same capacity as before.  One assumes he expected to be paid as he had been previously for the work he has continued to do since 2011, despite the denials that he has received money from the Malaysian Government.Multi-million pound property developments in LondonHad Mr Stadlen been paid in keeping with the sort of sums that were previously being channelled into Najib’s PR efforts, then it ought to be entirely within his means to have funded the purchase and development of a number of blocks of flats which have registered charges under his name.These enterprises have been carried out in tandem with a company director, who has opened and later wound up a number of companies linked to these projects, according to information registered at the UK Companies House.Developer Ben Kelly has been funded by loans from Stadlen with regard to the company Light Space Properties, which was incorporated in the UK in 2014 and is now being liquidated following the purchase, development and sale of a block of flats in Peckham Rye South East London.  With 7 flats either sold or on the market for an average of £600,000, the sale value of the block is estimated to have been over £4 million/ RM24 million.In June of this year the same developer Ben Kelly alongside a chartered surveyor Ben Gannon, under a new company, Lanbury Estates (Oakhurst) Limited, purchased a 9 flat block in Tiffany Court East Dulwich, together with a large car park space, complete with planning permission for a luxury block of flats in the up and coming neighbourhood. Again they were funded by a loan from Mr Stadlen:More at http://www.sarawakreport.org/2015/05/more-...gets-exclusive/"
