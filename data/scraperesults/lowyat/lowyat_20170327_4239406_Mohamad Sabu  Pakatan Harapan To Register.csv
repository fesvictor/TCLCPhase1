Opposition parties in Pakatan Harapan will seek to register the informal pact as an official coalition before the next general election, according to Parti Amanah Negara (Amanah) president Mohamad Sabu.He said this was agreed during the pact's first meeting formally involving Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM).""We will be registering Pakatan; 18 senior leaders will be included in the registration ahead of the general election,” he said during a press conference at Parliament today.The party leaders of PKR, DAP, Amanah and PPBM met earlier in the Parliament building today.Among those who also attended include PPBM chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, PPBM president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, PKR deputy president Datuk Seri Azmin Ali, and DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng.Mohamad Sabu, or better known as Mat Sabu, added the parties also decided to have a common manifesto and logo for elections, but did not state whether the pact will be renamed.""Seat negotiations are still in early stages and there is no certain answer yet,"" Mat Sabu added.Previous attempts to register Pakatan Rakyat, the predecessor to Pakatan Harapan, with the Registrar of Societies were unsuccessful.Dr Mahathir later said PPBM's demands for a Malay-led coalition were not brought up in today's meeting.""We were discussing about distribution of seats and only the principle, not actually division of seats,"" he told reporters after the meeting.The former prime minister then predicted that the 14th general election will be called before the automatic dissolution of Parliament.""According to the schedule of leave and functions and anniversaries, it should be between September this year to March of next year,"" Dr Mahathir claimed.http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...h.zPWXkl6A.dpuf"
