Maotze,20170728,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201707,,miracle wont happen but if oppo at last minute can have a deal and able to get support from Pas than only magic will happen. Who can get Pas support will win the GE as a big pool of malay voters coming from Pas supporters. Very sad reality actually but what to do since a lot of malay supporting Pas. That is the reason why Umno jilat kuat Pas lately.

A lot of MNC is considering to relocate their ASEAN HQ to Malaysia.There are already a few O&G company moving their ASEAN HQ to Malaysia. More will follow if SGD > RM still above 3. Singaporean economy is really worrying.I work in MNC and I can tell you most MNC is expanding their KL office and downsizing Singapore due to cost concern. If KL can do the job, they will shift it to KL."
