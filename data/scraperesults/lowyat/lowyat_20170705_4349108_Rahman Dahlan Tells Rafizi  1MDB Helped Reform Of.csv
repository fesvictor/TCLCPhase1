Stop the economic sabotage. Trust professional fund managers to do their jobs,” the minister in charge of the Economic Planning Unit said.In a statement, Abdul Rahman said the government made the first ever call for an open tender on Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) in September 2012 after 1MDB ventured into the IPP sector.“1MDB consistently put in the lowest bid for every new or renewal PPA thus helping to push down the PPA price for all other bidders.“As a result of this, many of the PPAs that were previously alleged to be lopsided are now made fairer,” he said.The minister noted that a major investment bank had confirmed 1MDB's role in helping eliminate the preferential treatment in the IPP sector.Abdul Rahman also said the reform had resulted in fairer power rates for the major producers and helped keep tariffs low for consumers.“For YB Rafizi's information, savings arising from the fairer PPA rates to Tenaga Nasional Berhad and Petronas gas subsidies — and by extension, to our government — is estimated to be as much as RM200 billion over the next 20 years period,"" he said.Abdul Rahman also noted that many of the allegedly lopsided concessions were signed under then Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, whom he pointed out is now Rafizi's political ally in the Pakatan Harapan Opposition pact.http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...er-tells-rafizi"
