That works out to RM1.8753 per litre at the then exchange rate of US$1:RM4.48.“MOPS95 averaged slightly higher at US$68.820 per barrel or US$0.4328 per litre in January. In turn, it translates to RM1.9130 per litre (US$1:RM4.42).“Hence, based on the exact explanation provided by the BN Strategic Communications Team, the difference in price is only 3.8 sen more for January,” Pua said, again questioning the justification for the government to increase the price of RON95 and RON97 by 20 sen.He reiterated his call for the finance ministry to disclose if Putrajaya was actually imposing hidden taxes on the consumers to cover up for the government’s budget shortfalls.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...rol-price-hike/"
