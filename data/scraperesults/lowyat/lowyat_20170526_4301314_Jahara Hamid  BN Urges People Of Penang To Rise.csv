Only those lost in purpose of life will join this table. Janji food in Penang still tasty, people has roof to brace through heavy weather, business run by locals, and it is not majority gain if land transacted within Malaysia from A to B as long as the land is used appropriately.But yeah, in business wise it might be own by foreign companies. If that's the case, please settle those ever growing illegal foreign business going on in our city-which-has-plagued-extremely-pandemic-of-<insert something>."

For example, I accept that keeping our country clean is very much our own responsibility, plus it would be great if our drivers and motorcyclists weren't mostly assholes all the time.But nevertheless, the govt has to be clean on its own without us needing to have to fix it by trying to vote them out of power."

Its one thing of the majority of the population opposes it, than its a people's movement to bring down a tyranny.But if half the people voted to have such a govt, probably the best thing to do is GTFO."
