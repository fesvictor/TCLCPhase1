Countries with high population density like Hong Kong are suffering losses and will bring problems to Penang.  Moreover, in Penang, it (the public transport) is not for the whole of Penang, only in certain parts.“There are not enough residents who want to use public transport to support this business. I do not see the logic of getting financing for the transport when the distance is short and there are not enough people (to use it),” he said in a press conference held at the State Legislative Assembly building here yesterday.Earlier, the Penang state assembly sitting passed the State of Penang Loan (Bank and Other Financial Source) Enactment 2017 which allows the state to take loans from China’s Exim Bank.When tabling the enactment, Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng said the loan was to pay for investment, physical, economic and social development and related matters incluing implementing the PTMP 2013-2030.Shah Headan said the state government must conduct a comprehensive study before making a decision to use the loan for the PTMP.Asked why no Barisan Nasional state assemblymen joined in the debate on the enactment, he said they did not want their statements to be manipulated by cyber troopers.The PTMP project which involves a cost of RM27 billion, includes a 6.5-km seabed tunnel, three highways, LRT and the Penang Sky Cab (cable car).  — Bernama http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...h.Ddu2pgMu.dpuf"
