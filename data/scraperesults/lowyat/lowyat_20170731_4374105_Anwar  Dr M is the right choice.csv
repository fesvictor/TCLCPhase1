He should be given the space to help expand the people’s movement,” he said.At the same time, Anwar welcomed NGOs and activists to continue evaluating Pakatan’s performance and to offer suggestions for improvement.“I continue to have confidence in their role to spearhead changes heading into the 14th general election,” he added.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...3xgAXZKDHT72.99"
