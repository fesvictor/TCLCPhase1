MilitaryMadness,20170131,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201010,From: Over your shoulder,"The view that Malaysia is 100% exporter of petroleum is a common misunderstanding. Actually, Malaysia imported significant amounts of lower grade petroleum for normal everyday use. This very much offsets the profits we get from oil exports.This is bcoz malaysian oil is a 'light and sweet' variety and very suitable to be refined into higher grades of fuel, like jet fuel and other very high-performance fuels compared to other crude petroleum grades. This why Malaysian petroleum very high demand (and price) in the industralized world. Sure our petroleum can be refine into regular petrol also, but that would be a massive waste of resources.That's why for everyday use automobile fuel, malaysia have to import lower grade petroleum from the middle east to be refined into diesel and petrol or buy refined fuel from Singapore refineries."

So can you justify why we are paying premium price but getting poor products. And u know if the petrol prices increase will lead to other raw materials price increase? I told u all many times already, how our government manage commodity is bullshxt and consumer suffer due to poor management. Soon Petronas will bankrupt and more retrenchment coming"
