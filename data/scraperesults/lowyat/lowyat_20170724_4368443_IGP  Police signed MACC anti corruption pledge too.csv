big[1],20170724,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 588,201506,,"KUALA LUMPUR: Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar has for the second time this month admitted that corruption exists in the force.The nation’s top cop said it was this concern about the menace that led to the department signing the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) corruption-free pledge.“Yes, there is. And this is among the steps taken to ensure corruption won’t continue and is eradicated immediately,” he said at a press conference with MACC chief commissioner Dzulkifli Ahmad.Khalid said he was determined to ensure that the department was corruption-free.Earlier this month, Khalid acknowledged there were police personnel who took bribes from the public and foreigners, including foreign students.However, he said, the police were constantly making efforts to stamp out the culture of corruption in the force and this included taking stern action against those caught taking bribes.Khalid’s admission came following his encounter with policemen last month when he spotted three patrolmen, including a lance corporal, conducting an unauthorised check on a foreign woman by the roadside in Semenyih, Selangor.The trio, aged between 25 and 36, were assigned desk duties for a month and ordered to undergo foot drills – non-stop marching and running – for a few hours at the Semenyih police station. It is not known if any further penalties were imposed on them.wxJRyH0-S7U"
