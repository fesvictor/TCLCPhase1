arubin,20170421,Holy Pastafarian,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 619,200710,From: Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster,"He's not interesting at all, except to that particular crowd and mindset where he just parrots what they want to hear.People like me just find that he's full of hot air. He's so easy to counter, but you can't do it at his speeches cos the crowd will be mostly on his side.He makes so little sense that I'm surprised people actually listen to him."

nuba,20170421,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201610,,True. His arguments were not really that convincing pun to change the audiences' belief i think. Point dia guna utk counter bila takleh jawab tu mmg ada perasan jugak.
