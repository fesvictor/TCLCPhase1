ironmaid89,20170710,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"Dr Mahathir Mohamad turns 92 today, and the nonagenarian is showing no signs of slowing down – at least with regard to his objective of removing Najib Abdul Razak as prime minister.With his mental faculties remaining razor sharp, Mahathir still possesses the strength and stamina to crisscross the nation to speak at various events on Najib's alleged misdeeds.Even Najib conceded how the former premier continued to appear vibrant despite his advanced age. But that was in a birthday wish he posted on Twitter in 2014 before their relationship went south.“89-years-old but still looking young and energetic, right? Happy birthday Tun Dr Mahathir! May Allah grant you longevity,” Najib had said then.89 tahun namun nampak muda bertenaga, kan? Selamat hari jadi Tun Dr Mahathir! Semoga Allah panjangkan umur. pic.twitter.com/P1BUqnNkzf— Mohd Najib Tun Razak (@NajibRazak) July 10, 2014Mahathir was born in 1925 in Alor Setar, Kedah.The medical doctor-turned-politician became the nation's fourth prime minister in 1981 and remained at the helm until 2003.During his 22-year tenure, Mahathir had four deputies, including jailed former opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who unlike his predecessors refused to fade without a noise.After sacking Anwar in 1998, a move which laid the foundation for the biggest political shift in Malaysian history a decade later, Mahathir had appointed Abdullah Ahmad Badawi as his number two and named him as his successor.Later, Mahathir went on the warpath against Abdullah and played a pivotal role in removing him after the 2008 general election and installing Najib as prime minister.Now, Mahathir is on a campaign to remove Najib, whom he has accused of plundering the nation.Najib, on the other hand, has accused Mahathir of attempting to topple him from power with false allegations.Pro-Najib supporters have claimed that Mahathir is being driven by the desire to elevate his son Mukhriz to the prime minister position.Unlike his previous attempt of unseating a prime minister, Mahathir has taken his campaign against Najib to a different level.He has joined hands with former adversaries in the opposition and even formed a new party with the aim of wiping out Umno and BN in the next general election.https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/388008"
