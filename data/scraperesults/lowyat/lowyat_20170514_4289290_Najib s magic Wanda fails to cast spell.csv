According to financial executives familiar with ongoing talks, Wanda has proposed to use half of the development for tourism and entertainment-related ventures valued at roughly US$8 billion,” the Singapore paper added.All media outlets, online and print, including The Star, quoted the Singapore report with expectations of an agreement to be signed with Wanda in Beijing this week hitting a feverish pitch.Hype turns damp squibHowever, with expectations set so high, the stage was set for a spectacular flop. The press conference announcement yesterday afternoon between Najib and Wanda’s chairperson Wang Jianlin in Beijing turned up a damp squib.Despite the prime minister’s over-the-top praise for Wanda, Wang’s brief response was measured in pure diplomatic speak.""Today, I also talked to the prime minister about this project. It is a large project worth over US$10 billion and we have not finalised a deal yet. We are very optimistic about Malaysia's investment and commercial climate. We are willing and ready to contribute our share to Malaysia's economic development and to create the one and only unique commercial centre in Malaysia,"" he said.Not even a face-saving, typically broadly-worded, non-committal memorandum of understanding was signed.The reason is likely quite simple. Dalian Wanda might be one of the richest private companies in China, making them an attractive target to sell perhaps, a grossly overpriced piece of real estate. But in all likelihood, Dalian Wanda became one of the most profitable companies in the world precisely because it doesn’t pay over-the-top prices of real estate - even if it is indeed prime real estate, especially if the seller is way more desperate than Wanda is interested.With the IWH deal dead and no super-wealthy knight-in-shining-armour in sight, the Finance Ministry needs to go back to the drawing board on its plans for Bandar Malaysia.The priority must not be to sell the land at the highest possible price with the intended purpose for the funds to bailout 1MDB. The priority to the land must be an economically sustainable development which will not only empower the Malaysian business community, but also in turn create meaningful job opportunities for ordinary Malaysians.TONY PUA is DAP national publicity secretary and Petaling Jaya Utara MP.The views expressed here are those of the author/contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of Malaysiakini."
