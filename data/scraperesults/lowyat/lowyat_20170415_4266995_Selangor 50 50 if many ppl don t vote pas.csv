cindy97,20170416,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201704,,But the way i see it for opposition supporters  non malay will vote dap. Malay will vote pas. BN will have a big laugh and winning big.
stormsea7,20170416,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 72,201105,,Since when Selangor people vote PAS?you don't go syok sendiri okay?Urban Malay don't vote PAS
cindy97,20170416,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201704,,check survey conducted by rafizi for selangor. It shows 23% votes PH and 21% votes Pas. In other words Pas alone have almost half of the total opposition votes. So without Pas in PH Selangor will be returned back to BN for sure.
stormsea7,20170416,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 72,201105,,"that guy sohai 1 lah""There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.""The sampling method is bullshit.Selangor have been ""opposition"" stronghold since 2008.As of now, PH holds 29 seats. BN only hold a pathetic 12 seats out of 56 seats. PAS only 13.The result speaks volume.And most of PAS seat was due to the PR coalition pre-2015.Selangor was voting PR just to kick BN.Now that PAS left PR and basically got played like a fool by BN.How many Selangor people would vote PAS?If the Selangor urban malay really wanted an ""Islamic"" party, PAS would not have such a pathetic number of seats."
LivingActive,20170416,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 10,201504,From: RobotPencariEmel.com,U didn't count pas voter at non pas seat?
stormsea7,20170416,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 72,201105,,"how to count?the current seat is based on 2013 election, when PR still exist.Under PR, the coalition hardly contest against each other. We don't the true make up of the voter.We don't know if PAS had vs DAP and PKR, the voter would vote who.But it's clear under PR, vote are overwhelmingly against BN.People prefer the Opposition over BNeven if PAS split off, would the voter suddenly prefer BN?"

alexcky,20170416,business Sifu,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 754,200711,,Never assume.. Anything can happen BN oso will have high chance loose next GE unless they use dirty trick again
cindy97,20170416,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201704,,It will become 3 corner fights. Ph vs BN vs Pas. Since pr already split into ph and pas so bn can easily win. Selangor no hope buy penang i think ph still can win.
LivingActive,20170416,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 10,201504,From: RobotPencariEmel.com,Pas voter stil voting PAS. That means decreasing in non pas oppo voter. So PAS voter still relevant on PH seat count too compared by previous general elections.

While DAP may retain their stronghold seats because of their dominance in non-malay areas, PKR and Amanah may sink deep in Malay majority constituents. Amanah can only attract ex-pas members."

Then claim got terrorist activity during election and close down the voting site until evening. Or just hire thugs to shout at Chinese to scare people away. Less vote, higher chance for them to win."
