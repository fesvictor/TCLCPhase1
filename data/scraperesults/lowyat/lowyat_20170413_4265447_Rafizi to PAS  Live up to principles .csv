PAS as an Islamic party should be more concerned,” the Pandan MP said.He then advised PAS leaders to review its past and recent sources of funds, especially considering the alleged close ties between Nasharudin and Umno.According to Rafizi, the payment to Nasharudin was made in exchange for PAS’ silence on all matters concerning 1MDB.“I find it strange that PAS now appears to be avoiding 1MDB matters. And the party’s most outspoken leader who had received information straight from the horse’s mouth has until now, said nothing about it.”Rafizi was referring to PAS Dewan Ulama information chief Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali, who he said had met with the same informant from whom he got his information too.Meanwhile, Rafizi said he hoped MACC would not keep mum on his revelation and the evidence he had obtained, which he would hand over to the anti-graft agency tomorrow morning.“This is a test case for the new MACC leadership. They are on a hyperdrive now to show that they are independent. So, this is the time to prove it.”Nasharudin was known to have championed the unity government agenda between PAS and Umno. He is currently heading the Global Movement of Moderates (GMM), which is Najib’s brainchild.Najib has repeatedly denied pocketing public funds, and has been cleared of any wrongdoing by Attorney-General Mohamed Apandi Ali.FMT tried to reach Nasharudin, but he has yet to answer any calls or respond to text messages."
