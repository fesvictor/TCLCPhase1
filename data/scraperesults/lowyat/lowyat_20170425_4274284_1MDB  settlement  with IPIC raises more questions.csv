No figures are stated.IPIC, on the other hand, made a detailed announcement to the London Stock Exchange, clearly stating that:(i) IPIC will receive US$1.205 billion in two equal tranches on July 31, 2017 and Dec 31, 2017.(ii) 1MDB and MoF Inc (Ministry of Finance Incorporated), will assume all responsibility of future interest and principal payments of US$3.5 billion worth of bonds, previously guaranteed by IPIC.The implication between the two statements is staggering.1MDB tried to paint a rosy picture of the settlement – that the dispute had been resolved with no hard details.On the other hand, IPIC’s announcement clearly showed that they got exactly what they wanted, the return of US$1.205 billion worth of cash advances to 1MDB since June 2015 and to discharge itself entirely as a guarantor for 1MDB’s US$3.5 billion worth of bonds.However, of greater significance is the fact that 1MDB’s concession to the above settlement terms is a direct affirmation and confirmation that 1MDB has lost US$3.51 billion worth of payments which have purportedly been paid to IPIC and its subsidiary, Aabar Investments PJS.Last year, 1MDB and its CEO, Arul Kanda, informed the auditor-general (AG) and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that the following payments were made to Aabar Investments PJS Limited, a separate company registered in the British Virgin Islands (“Aabar(BVI))”.It is already widely known, and confirmed by the United States Department of Justice (US DOJ) that Aabar (BVI) is a fraudulent impostor company. However, 1MDB and Arul Kanda continued to insist that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the IPIC group.As outlined on Page 92 of the PAC Report on 1MDB, 1MDB claimed it has paid Aabar (BVI) the amounts of:(i) US$1.367 billion as a “security deposit” for the US$3.5 billion of bonds in 2012;(ii) US$993 billion for the termination of options granted to IPIC or Aabar in November 2014; and,(iii) Additional sums of US$855 million and US$295 million as “top-up security deposit” in September and December 2014 respectively.These sums, as emphasised in the PAC Report, could not be verified by the AG as 1MDB has refused to provide the relevant proof and documentation of the transactions, despite repeated requests over months.The question then is, if we have indeed paid the above sums, totalling US$3.51 billion to IPIC or its subsidiaries, why then are we allowing IPIC to relieve itself as ultimate guarantor for the bonds and why is MOF Inc assuming the US$3.5 billion liability?Is 1MDB and Arul Kanda telling us that despite having paid US$3.51 billion to IPIC, we still owe the US$3.5 billion we borrowed?Putting it simply, are Malaysians to fork out a whopping US$7.01 billion to settle 1MDB’s US$3.5 billion of bonds?The only explanation for the incredulous situation is that the US$3.51 billion was never paid to IPIC as claimed. Instead, the funds were misappropriated or laundered as documented widely in the US DOJ charges against Jho Low and company, and Singapore’s prosecution of its local banking officers.Therefore, we call upon the prime minister, who is also the finance minister, Najib Razak, to come clean on the discrepancy resulting from the “settlement” with IPIC since Malaysians have now to pay more than double what was actually borrowed by 1MDB.Tony Pua is DAP national publicity secretary and Petaling Jaya Utara MPWith a firm belief in freedom of expression and without prejudice, FMT tries its best to share reliable content from third parties.

He's not a part of the government either to be kept abreast of what 1MDB is doing. Tony is not a part of IPIC to get any updates directly from them. He relies on news articles, press statements and filings just like the rest of us at the moment. Besides, he's always getting attacked for his questions on 1MDB so it makes a lot more sense to wait for IPIC's more detailed statement than relying on skeletal information shared by an anonymous source with newspapers, which he clearly mentioned in his statement.Also, as far as I remember, the person who kept bringing up the 50 billion loss was Mahathir."

neoexcaliber,20170425,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,Untrue. Tony did repeatedly mention that 1MDB refused to furnish the PAC with foreign bank account statements and the Cayman Island funds were never independently valued. The only reason Deloitte signed off on it was because of the guarantee provided by Aabar and Deloitte has since withdrawn their support for the audit they signed off on previously.

Reuters reported on the matter on June 14, 2016 and provided the breakdown of the claim: “IPIC is claiming the US$3.5 billion bond plus interest that amounts to US$4.8 billion, the US$1.2 billion loan plus interest, and about US$481 million owed to Aabar  adding up to US$6.5 billion, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.”The settlement announced today is substantially the same as IPIC’s original demand in 2016, save for possibly some minor waiver of interests. IPIC will get their US$1.2 billion in two tranches of US$603 million each in July 2017 and December 2017. More importantly, the MoF will also undertake to pay all interest and principal payments from the US$3.5 billion bond which now must surely amount to more than US$4.8 billion. The settlement however makes no mention on the US$481 million owed to Aabar.While Abu Dhabi has taken proper actions to remove from IPIC and freeze the accounts of Mr Qubaisi and Mr Husseiny, and in addition, arrested Mr Qubaisi, all the people on the Malaysian side responsible for the world’s biggest ever case of kleptocracy, remain free from any actions whatsoever by the Malaysian authorities.This settlement serves to only benefit Prime Minister Najib Razak and his friends. Instead of justice and closure, this settlement today further ingrains the culture of corruption and impunity in Malaysia at the expense of the people.Wong Chen is PKR Member of Parliament for Kelana Jaya.With a firm belief in freedom of expression and without prejudice, FMT tries its best to share reliable content from third parties.

It is hoped that 1MDB and IPIC can take that final step to resolve the final USD3.5 billion.The fact that IPIC has now finally acknowledged there was USD3.5 billion of such payments from 1MDB to ""certain parties"" means yet another critical step for 1MDB to finally clear all its controversies and ""missing money"" allegations.A basic foundation of the July 2016 US DOJ civil suit was due to the fact that 1MDB said it had paid money ti IPIC but IPIC had then said earlier in 2016 they did not receive such money - thus there is missing money and hence money laundering.Now that IPIC has admitted that there was such payments then there is no ""missing money"" and hence no money laundering."

LSS is even trotting them out, claiming that the money to repay IPIC will come from these 'Brazen Sky' fund units, but what are they really? I have to wonder if LSS himself even knows WTF they are.Because info is most certainly scarce. Just try Googling for them. Once you sift through all the news about the 1MDB scandal, you end up with...nothing. Yes, nothing. Well, they are a wholly owned subsidiary of 1MDB registered in the Cayman Islands. The fund units in them are purpotedly worth about 940 million...but...why? Who are they?No website, no info, no details, no board, no portfolio...I mean for a investment fund, surely there should be a prospectus or something out there, indicating who they are, what they do, what their assets are, why they are worth so much, etc.But no...they're just a figure on 1MDB's asset sheet...which will be sold to an 'undisclosed' buyer for somewhere close to 940 million. Err...are you bailing us out again, China? What are you guys asking for this time?Not to say there's no news about them, but what exists ain't pretty because that fund was apparently once managed by BSI Singapore, and we all know what happened to them. MAS suspended their license to operate in SG because of money laundering, oh dear...Anyway, they are now managed by a 'mystery bank'. Oh, FFS...is there anything about Brazen Sky that is not a fucking mystery? Its almost as though we just have to take 1MDB's word for it that they DO have money somewhere in some fund, and that it's worth something, and that they have a someone to sell it to. But the details of it are like...top secret or something. Jangan persoal.I mean even the auditors aren't allowed to take a further look into such dealings, which is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the Big 4 all treated the account like a hot potato. https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/sear...2&hl=en&ct=clnkDid Deloitte get those documents though, or did they sign off regardless? So many questions...So yeah...you macais care to answer a few question? Get this LSS to fill in for you, since you like referring to him so much.TL;DR to keep it simple - who the hell are Brazen Sky, and why are they worth what 1MDB claims they are worth?C'mon...educate the rest of us 'ignorant' folks who know so little about 1MDB like you guys like to claim.

The letter 1MDB shared with the PAC is not the same as the letter Johari is talking about. The letter is regarding Aabar BVI and the ownership allegations were that it's owned by 2 IPIC former executives. Opposition MPs claimed that it was Good Star that belonged to Jho Low. Don't get confused please.The authorities might be true on certain things but it seems like you're more likely to be wrong most of the time.

You can't claim MoF or 1MDB is not paying double when the negotiations are still ongoing. You're the one spinning the issue when it hasn't been settled yet. Why don't you wait for the authorities instead of spinning and twisting here and there?"
