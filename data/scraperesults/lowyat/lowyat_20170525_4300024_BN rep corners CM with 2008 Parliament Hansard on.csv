Maybe you have never run a government before. I would like to stress that open tenders are indeed our policy.“We make sure all deals are made via open tenders. Direct negotiations are made usually for disaster relief or strategic investments. In this case, Island Hospital, Ikea and other big multinational firms.“This is our policy. But policies can be amended if the state executive council changes them,” Lim said.Earlier, opposition leader Jahara Hamid (BN-Telok Ayer Tawar) had asked Lim why the Peel Avenue land sold to Island Hospital had been “fast-tracked” without much hassle.Jahara also questioned Lim why this kind of fast-tracking was not allowed for federal-sanctioned affordable homes projects, which were in a backlog.“Air Putih, (Lim) is your open tender policy ‘mutlak’ (absolute)?” Jahara asked Lim.Lim then said he had never said it was absolute and the Peel Avenue land deal began in 2015.“How is it possible to fast-track the deal? The hospital project will only take off if a hospital licence is obtained from the health ministry,” Lim said.He added federal housing projects were not 100% affordable as many units were priced beyond “RM1.8 million”.Hence, Lim said, they were rejected. If the federal contractors can return with a 100% affordable project, the Penang government would approve it, he added.It was reported that Island Hospital Sdn Bhd had already put a downpayment of RM30 million for the Peel Avenue land, owned by Chief Minister Incorporated.The remainder of the RM126 million (of the total RM156 million) owed must be made in three months after a hospital licence is acquired.The hospital has been given two years to acquire the licence from the health ministry. If it fails to do this, it will forfeit 2% of the RM30 million given as down-payment for the land.Island Hospital Sdn Bhd plans to build an “Island Medical City” comprising an initial 600-bed hospital. This will be increased to 1,000 beds in the future.A hotel will also be built in the later stages. The project is also expected to provide 2,000 employment opportunities, from low-skilled jobs to medical specialists.The gross development value of the project is projected to be between RM2 billion and RM7 billion."
