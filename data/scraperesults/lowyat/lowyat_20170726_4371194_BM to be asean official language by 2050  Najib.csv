In fact, its stature will always be upheld all the way to the international level.""As we head towards 2050, I wish to see Bahasa Melayu become Asean's main and official language, as well as a top lingua franca at global level,"" said Najib, in his speech at the 2017 International Public Speaking (Pidato) Prime Minister's Trophy competition on Wednesday.Najib said in the Malaysian context, the Malay language has always been upheld, with the country's earliest leaders making it the national and official language.""As a multiracial country, the Malay language is used to unite the people, ensuring that there is peace and harmony.""The mastery of the Malay language among Malaysians is also done in a planned and inclusive way, while at the same time other languages like English are celebrated and not neglected,"" said Najib.The Prime Minister also praised the Higher Education Ministry's move to make it compulsory for international students to take up Bahasa Malaysia as a subject.In its 11th edition, this year's competition featured some 53 contestants from 35 countries.The theme of this year's competition is ""Internationalising Bahasa Melayu"".Also present at the event were Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Idris Jusoh, Najib's wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor and Higher Education Ministry secretary-general Tan Sri Dr Noorul Ainur Mohd Nur.sos"

Better enforce or improve our children's mastery in BM in the country first before aim for ASEAN level.Different PM, different vision. Now is Bijan time, previous PM's vision no longer under his interest.Do you recall or remember any of Pak Lah's vision or legacy after he retired? Me neither. It's either Bahasa Indonesia or Bahasa Melayu, but then we and Indonesia might go for war just because of it, heh."

Indonesia2. Malaysia3. Brunei4. SingaporeWith non-negligible number of speakers in5. Thailand (about 1 million)6. Southern Philippines (?)That's a big chunk of ASEAN right there, and population wise, with Indonesia in the mix, that's a majority already.It probably all depends on whether Indonesia in future chooses to use its size to move in that direction. I doubt Malaysia has the clout as its population is a bit too small."

malaysiaboleh2017,20170727,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201707,,"interestingly enough, the Philippine military teaches BI to soldiers who will be working closely with Indo army units, because of close relations between the two countries.you have to remember that Malay has been (and still is in its BI form) a lingua franca and is thus relatively simple in its grammar. it is fairly easy to pick up a working knowledge of the language compared to most other languages.Obviously it's a big jump from soldiers to diplomats, but one possibility is to have BI as one of the official working languages of ASEAN at first."

arubin,20170727,Holy Pastafarian,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 619,200710,From: Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster,Quite significant differences in pronunciation though. Bigger issue than you might think.There needs to be standardization for a lingua franca. This also means deferring to their standard. Will local pride allow it?
