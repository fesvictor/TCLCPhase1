One of the reasons they lost in the last election was because they failed to unite under one symbol,” he said.On seat distribution, he said this has yet to be decided as Pribumi is not officially part of Pakatan.On its cooperation with PAS, Dr Mahathir said Pribumi is open to forging political ties with any party, and not just the Islamist party.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...WFMskPYR9VEj.99"
