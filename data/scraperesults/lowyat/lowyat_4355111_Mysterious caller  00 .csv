They asked me whether i am knowledgeable about forex and stocks trading and such. I asked for their company's name but the caller's accent was just so thick i cant understand them. 3 person has called me so far. One of them claimed to be from greece. Even just know a guy said i was researching about trading(i was at the gym!!) They even have my email address. Very suspicious. Ofc i ended the call early without giving them anymore vital infos. But this is worrying me.You guys know more about this??"
