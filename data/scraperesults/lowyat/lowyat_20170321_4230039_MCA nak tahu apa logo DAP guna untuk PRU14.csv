Vape [On],20170321,Regular,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,069",201511,,"PETALING JAYA: MCA should worry about staying relevant in the current political scene instead of asking which logo DAP will use in the coming general election, the DAP Youth wing said today.In a statement, DAP Socialist Youth executive secretary Muhammad Shakir Ameer Mohideen thanked MCA deputy president Wee Ka Siong for his concern but said “whether DAP decides to use its own logo or another representing Pakatan Harapan is clearly none of his business”.Shakir was referring to Wee’s statement yesterday in which the MCA man had asked if DAP would forgo its rocket logo and run under a new one when contesting in Chinese-majority areas.Wee had also said the opposition often made conflicting statements and had no common stand on issues apart from replacing Barisan Nasional (BN).Instead of worrying about which logo DAP would use in GE14, Shakir said MCA should feel embarrassed that Umno was so dominant in BN that MCA had no say in policy implementation.He also hit out at Wee for saying that Pakatan Harapan often made conflicting statements.He pointed to PAS’ proposed amendments to the Shariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1965, also known as Act 355.It was now a government bill to be tabled in the current parliamentary sitting, and MCA was part of that government, he said.“This shows MCA is oblivious and lacks principles. DAP, on the other hand, has always been consistent with its stand against Act 355 amendments which goes against the Federal Constitution.”Shakir said MCA should understand the difference between being subservient and having consensual agreement on government policies which would affect all Malaysians.“What is MCA doing about the slashing of the budget by the government for Chinese schools?” he asked.“There is not a single sound made on that matter by MCA that claims to be representing the Chinese community in the government, and (being) so-called ‘champions’ of Chinese education.”DAP, meanwhile, had always maintained consistency on vernacular education and had spoken on behalf of all communities regardless of race or religion, he said.Saying MCA had its own party logo, yet had been using BN logo, he challenged MCA to use its logo in Chinese majority seats in the coming election to prove its relevance.Instead of nitpicking on issues such as party logos, MCA should focus on pushing for the implementation of relevant policies, Shakir said.“It is known that MCA is becoming more and more irrelevant among the Chinese community due to its subservience to Umno.”http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...f-not-our-logo/"
