However, during Marcos Ferdinand reign, GDP growth has been rising steady until 1984 global economic crisis, where Filipino put all blame on their dictators. But after Marcos exile, the economy were in downward trend during 90s after failed management of few presidents, until Aquino beningo and duterte era economy only coming back.Bijan maybe corrupted, but still consider above average to make country grows. I not sure whether PH collations are able to do that or make us another Philippines PH again."
