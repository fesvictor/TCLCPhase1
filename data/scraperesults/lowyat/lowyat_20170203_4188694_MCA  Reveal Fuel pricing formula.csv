Contrary to popular BN propaganda and pathetic apologists, no one knows the exact formula used to calculate the price. Thats why you get ""almost true"" figures that are speculated to be true. Even a discrepancy of 0.1sen and any rounding up/down means the ""formulas"" are just speculations and not the exact calculation. The Government said subsidies are gone, yet we know for a fact that Najib ordered the delay of a fuel price hike back last year. All of these factors mean we cannot be 100% sure of the calculation mechanism. This is further evidence that we can discard any ""formulas"" provided.People who say the formula is already known and legit is lying and are BN shills, or are just naive enough to consider themselves as professional bloggers/mathematician/economist wannabes.I also laugh at ""calculations"" and spreadsheets which assume any discrepancies are ""subsidy/taxes"". That's just poor maths and false assumptions. News by Malaysiakini.http://dlvr.it/NGxnSL"
