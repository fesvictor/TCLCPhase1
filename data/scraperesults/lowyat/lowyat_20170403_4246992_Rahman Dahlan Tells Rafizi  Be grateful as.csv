If Rafizi says this is unfair, I do not know what to say anymore,"" said Abdul Rahman.""Developing the economy is not the work of the government. Rafizi is also responsible. He should not play too much politics,"" Abdul Rahman told reporters after opening the Syndication Laboratory of the Bumiputera Economic Transformation Roadmap 2.0, here Monday.Rafizi, also PKR vice-president, reportedly questioned Abdul Rahman’s role in the agreement which led to Petronas paying more for Saudi crude oil.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...yvQtFicapZly.99"
