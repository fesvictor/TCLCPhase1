It is an additional cost to the tourism industry. We also go to Peninsular Malaysia either for business or leisure and if hotels there impose this tax, we have to pay for it. So it is across the board.”In addition, Chong also urged Tourism, Arts, Culture, Youth and Sports Minister Datuk Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah to stand firm and ensure that Sarawak hoteliers are not required to pay the Tourism Tax.In view of the recent spat between Abdul Karim and Tourism and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nazri Abdul Aziz, Chong said it serves no purpose if, after Abdul Karim’s outburst, hoteliers are still subject to the said Tourism Tax.“While all Sarawakians appreciate the firm stand of Abdul Karim against Nazri, it serves no purpose if Abdul Karim’s colleagues, the Sarawak BN representatives in the Federal Cabinet, continue to ‘sell out’ and ‘betray’ the interests of Sarawak.”Chong also noted that the Tourism Tax Act is not the first law that the Sarawak BN ministers approved in recent years that eroded Sarawak’s rights.“Examples of which can be seen in the following Acts namely Territorial Sea Act, 2012; Goods and Services Tax Act, 2014; National Security Council Act, 2016; PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang’s Hudud Bill Motion in 2017 and annual federal budgets up to year 2017 under which Sarawak was given unfair allocations.”Chong said at the end of the day, after all the excitement created by the shouting match between Abdul Karim and Nazri and the talk of autonomy, Sarawak’s interests continued to be eroded with the approval of BN Sarawak in federal cabinet and Sarawakians continuing to be shortchanged.http://www.theborneopost.com/2017/06/13/bn...tform=hootsuite"
