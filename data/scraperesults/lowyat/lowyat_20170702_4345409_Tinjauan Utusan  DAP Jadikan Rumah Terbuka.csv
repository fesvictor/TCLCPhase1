Samad Said.Lebih mengejutkan, beberapa risalah mengandungi pelbagai isu politik yang memburuk-burukkan Kerajaan Barisan Nasional (BN) diedarkan pihak penganjur kepada semua pengunjung majlis yang turut dihadiri kanak-kanak.Walau bagaimanapun, majlis yang bermula pada pukul 12 tengah hari itu dilihat tidak mendapat sambutan apabila banyak meja di dewan berkenaan kosong dan pengunjung mula pulang kira-kira pukul 2.30 petang meskipun majlis belum selesai. - UTUSAN ONLINEhttp://www.utusan.com.my/berita/politik/da...8#ixzz4ldDGpgkJ"

xtrabite,20170702,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 136,200903,From: Pengu world,Banner stated open house. But open house mana orang bagi speech.More like formal occasion.Failed the spirit of aidilfitri.

neoexcaliber,20170702,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,How ironic that they say 'jangan cemarkan aidilfitri dengan politik' when the Raya sermon I heard was disturbingly political.And everyone's recycling that one single photo of the pamphlets.

I thought the speech is something normal since the house is hosted by that politician.So, here I'm surprised to see ppl saying that a speech shouldn't be delivered."

aizielectreon,20170702,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 306,200905,,i think every minister or politician got allocation..elaun keraian or something like that..
Ibrahimovic,20170702,*HolyHunk*,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,516",200708,From: Johor-Singapore,Hmm.. Wouldn't it be nice to use government coffer to promote your own party and belittle your opponent rather than your own party money? It's very nice indeed
