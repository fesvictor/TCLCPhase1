There is only one way to do this, which is through the election. So we should change the government in GE14.“If I, who was once president of Umno, could leave the party, we hope the people who love Malaysia would do the same,” Mahathir is quoted as saying by Sinar Harian today.For the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year (full news access)or RM420 a year (full news + full archive access).

I know many people think the way you do, but imo at least he tried to do something about it. Anyway, I am not gonna give him my first vote unless his party can come up with something that's going to benefit me"
