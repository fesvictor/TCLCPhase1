Even Umno divisions in the east coast have collapsed.“Just go and see for yourself,” Siambun was quoted as saying by the Kota Kinabalu-based daily.He cited Sandakan as an example.The Warisan leader was begging to differ with a statement by Penampang MCA chairman Francis Goh, who said the “winds of change” will be blowing in Sarawak, “because there’s no Umno there”, but not in Sabah.Sabah will not end up overnight under an opposition-controlled state government, reiterated Goh, but the possibility exists in Sarawak.“The ‘winds of change’ are in Sabah for sure despite what MCA feels.“In 2013, it was premature to talk about the change starting in Sabah, but in the next general election (GE14) it will be the real thing,” Siambun was quoted as saying, calling it an impending “political tsunami”.Siambun, who won the Moyog state seat under the PKR ticket in the last general election (GE13), added that he may not be the automatic candidate in the seat for GE14.“No one will be an automatic candidate in any seat. Given a chance, I will defend Moyog. It’s too early to say,” he said, according to Daily Express.The state opposition won 12 state seats and four parliamentary seats in Sabah in 2013.On that note, Siambun believes that Warisan will only be able to sit down with the other opposition parties after his party has introduced itself first throughout the state.“We have to meet the people first being a Sabah party. Then, we may be able to meet with the other local parties at a big round table,” he said, adding such a meeting will also help determine “who we are going to work with, and who can work with us”.Admitting it was still too early to say “yes” or “no” to working with other opposition parties, he clarified that other parties had approached Warisan asking to work together in preparation for GE14."

The people know which party has fought for them and brought development to the people of Sabah,” said Rosnah, who is Papar MP.Umno is the lynchpin of the state BN, holding 31 of the 48 state seats won by the BN in the last state election, which was held together with the last general election in May 2013.“BN has a good track record in Sabah and with the leadership of Prime Minister Najib Razak and Chief Minister Musa Aman, development will continue in Sabah.”Rosnah, who is deputy works minister, said unlike BN, Warisan was still “unproven”.She said even when the party’s leaders were in the government, namely Warisan president Shafie Apdal, they didn’t do much for Sabah.“Shafie didn’t fight for Sabah when he was the rural and regional development minister, a very powerful portfolio.“When Shafie was in the government, he wasn’t a team player and didn’t do much for the state,” Rosnah claimed.However, she admitted that Sabah BN could not take things for granted and had to work hard to get the people’s support in the next general election (GE14)."
