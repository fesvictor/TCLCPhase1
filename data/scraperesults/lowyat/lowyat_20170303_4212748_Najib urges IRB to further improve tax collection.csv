Coup De Grace,20170303,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,201611,,"CYBERJAYA: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak (pic) wants the Inland Revenue Board (IRB) to improve its tax collection so that the country’s development will not be disrupted and that it will be able to provide better service to the people.Najib, who is also Finance Minister, said if the national revenue contracted, it would have a negative impact on the country.He said it was the board’s duty to continue to improve on its tax collection efforts and reduce the number of tax-evaders.“We are aware of countries, such as some in Europe, that suffer from problems that they have to borrow from other countries.“Among the causes of this are citizens who refuse to pay tax, or the authorities’ failure to collect tax.“You must aim to collect taxes optimally.“We do not want too many people evading paying tax, or underground economy, that it becomes too large a figure, that it takes a huge cut from the country’s revenue.“You must reduce this leakage, instil an element of fear among tax-evaders if you will, so they do not escape,” said Najib at the Inland Revenue Board’s 21st anniversary celebration here on Wednesday night.Najib congratulated the board for managing to collect RM114bil in individual and corporate taxes last year.“For 2017, IRB is targeting a collection of RM127.7bil. I’m sure with a strong will, you will achieve this,” he said.Paying taxes, he said, should be viewed as a civic and moral responsibility.“If all the citizens of a country realise that it is their moral and social responsibility to pay taxes, then that country will continue to prosper.“If we want to give our children a good education, if we want our medical services to be on par with developed nations and our highways to be smooth and without potholes, we must realise that this requires revenue.“With this in mind, when paying your taxes, you know it is your contribution towards the country and wellbeing of its people,” said Najib.Also present at the event were deputy finance ministers Datuk Othman Aziz and Datuk Lee Chee Leong, Treasury secretary-general Tan Sri Dr Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah and IRB chief executive officer Datuk Sabin Sabitah.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...2S2klUGuF2rg.99"
