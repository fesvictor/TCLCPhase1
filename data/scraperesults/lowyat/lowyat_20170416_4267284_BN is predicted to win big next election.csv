Coup De Grace,20170416,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,201611,,"Prof Hoo Kee Ping menggariskan 4 faktor, termasuk pertandingan 3 penjuru, yang bakal memihak BN berbanding pembangkang.PETALING JAYA: Seorang pemerhati politik meramalkan Barisan Nasional (BN) akan memenangi lebih banyak kerusi jika Pilihan Raya Umum ke-14 (PRU14) dipanggil dalam 10 bulan akan datang.Prof Hoo Kee Ping yang pernah melakukan kajian mengenai corak pilihan raya umum di Malaysia berkata, kemungkinan kemenangan akan memihak BN.Menurut beliau, terdapat 4 faktor yang memihak BN berbanding pembangkang.Yang pertama, kata beliau, kemungkinan persaingan 3 penjuru antara Umno-Pakatan Harapan-PAS.Sebab kedua, menurut beliau, adalah kelembapan ekonomi yang menyebabkan ramai pengundi Cina cenderung untuk memilih BN demi kestabilan.Sebab ketiga, perbalahan dalaman dalam Pakatan Harapan dan ini disusuli dengan persempadanan semula kawasan pilihan raya yang membabitkan pengundi Melayu aand Cina.Beliau diminta mengulas mengenai kenyataan Perdana Menteri Datuk Ser Najib Razak semalam, BN sudah bersedia untuk menghadapi PRU14 walaupun ia dipanggil lebih awal.Najib, pengerusi BN dan presiden Umno, berkata, persiapan rapi sedang dilakukan oleh parti komponen BN dan Umno, dan beliau yakin jentera pilihan raya mereka kuat bagi memastikan kemenangan.Kata Kee Ping, yang kini memberi ceramah mengenai ekonomi dan politik Malaysia berkata, pengundi Felda yang membentuk hampir 60 kerusi Parlimen dan hampir 100 kerusi Dewan Undangan Negeri pula berpuas hati dengan Umno memandangkan harga minyak sawit dijangka naik.“Apabila pengundi Melayu luar bandar berpuas hati dengan kerajaan, mereka akan mengundi mereka (Umno) dan sebaliknya, apabila mereka marah dengan parti pemerintah.”Bagaimanapun, proses pengundian adalah berbeza dalam kalangan pengundi Cina.“Apabila ekonomi baik, pengundi Cina memihak pembangkang tetapi apabila ekonomi tidak baik, mereka memilih kestabilan,” kata beliau sambil menambah, lebih ramai orang Cina dijangka mengundi BN.Kee Ping berkata, pengundi-pengundi bandar akan terus mengundi pembangkang tetapi undi mereka mungkin berpecah jika persempadanan semula sempadan kerusi Parlimen dilaksanakan.Sebagai contoh, pengundi Cina dari Wangsa Maju, Bandar Tun Razak dan Pantai Dalam akan pergi kepada DAP dan kubu kuat PKR di Seputeh, Cheras dan Batu.Kawasan-kawasan lain seperti Lumut pula, selepas persempadanan semula, akan mempunyai majoriti 70% Melayu yang akan memihak Umno.Pada masa yang sama, beliau meramalkan Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) kemungkinan tidak akan memenangi kerusi kerana parti itu masih lemah.Beliau membuat perbandingan dengan langkah Tengku Razeleigh Hamzah pada 1987 di mana Umno telah berpecah antara pasukan A yang menyokong Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad dan Team B yang memihak Razaleigh.Ketika itu, katanya, beberapa menteri, timbalan menteri dan ahli Parlimen telah mengikut langkah Razaleigh.“Tetapi tiada menteri atau timbalan menteri mengikut (Tan Sri) Muhyiddin (Yassin), (Datuk Seri) Mukhriz (Mahathir) dan (Datuk Seri) Shafie (Apdal). Tiada yang mengikut.“Jadi, tidak ada perpecahan dalam Umno,” kata beliau.Beliau berkata, tidak seperti Pakatan Harapan yang mempunyai perbalahan, BN berjaya menunjukkan barisan yang bersatu.“Pakatan belum datang dengan keputusan siapa yang akan menjadi perdana menteri jika mereka menang. Mereka perlu tegas dengan keputusan,” katanya.Kata beliau, BN kemungkinan besar akan muncul sebagai pemenang PRU14 disebabkan pertembungan tiga penjuru.“Undi akan berpecah. Dan kerana empat faktor, kemungkinan memihak kepada BN,” katanya.Malah kata beliau, BN akan terus memenangi Sabah dan Sarawak.Akhir tahun lepas, SPR mencadangkan untuk meminda sempadan kawasan pilihan raya beberapa bahagian Parlimen dan negeri di seluruh negara kecuali Perlis, Labuan dan Putrajaya. http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...rusi-pru-depan/"

In politics appearances matter, the fact that the opposition became poster boys of the rallies de-legitimize what Bersih stood for. And to date we have not been able to make a dent in the proposals set by Federal i.e. delineation, voter blocks etc.To compare sports as an example is grossly misleading as it is unfair, it's only a symptom and not addressing the elephant in the room..Question we need to be asking is, are the people ready to take the risk of destabilized government/economy if and when the opposition takes over or when there is a hung parliament? I don't think so.Are we annoyed at the constant bickering by the opposition and or 'brainless statements' by the federal gov ministers? You're damn right we are."

Management set the direction and the culture u work inBe it in sport, organizations, government, or ngo.. It's all related to how u manage it. That's why when the company not perform, the first who get sack is the management, not the staff level. I think the risk is worth to take.. Our country definitely is loosing every aspect, this is bad and some of u can't see the impact from this. One by one business will close down and shift to other countries, people get to retrench at the end. Currency drop will also affect the business profit, at the end no more increment for the staff. So is the risk of change the gov worth to take? I would say yes without any hesitation"

MasBoleh!,20170416,Regular,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,079",200906,From: MYBoleh.NET,"Inflation especially in developed countries are very stable with minimal increment just enough to keep the economy moving forward. Daily products has been remained affordable. Foods from restaurant/cafe also affordable. Technologies such as smartphone and gadgets still affordable. Secondly, they do not have large scale corruption scandal and also their General Audit Report yearly do not show wastage of public funds. Thirdly, their PM/President will not use public fund to build a race track or even for personal holidays. SO many factors more that resulted Malaysian losing faith on their government. When Malaysian do not have faith on government, they will not pay taxes willingly which included GST. Hence, lots of complain about the GST. Last but not least, take SG for example, when they started GST, they put it 3% and gradually raise it slowly to prevent a spike in inflation , but what did MY government do? Straight slap a 6% GST. And also the lack of government support and assurance towards the SME/Small retailer which have been badly affected by the implementation of GST."
