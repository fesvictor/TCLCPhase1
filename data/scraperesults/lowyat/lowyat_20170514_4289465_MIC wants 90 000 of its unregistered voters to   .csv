Subramaniam (pic) said the party noticed discrepancies between its list of members and the Election Commission's voters list.''There are about 120,000 members whose names are not in the list and we see that some could be due to documents or other problems.""Allowing for that, we are looking at registering at least 90,000-odd members who are not yet voters,'' he said after officiating the Klang MIC division voter registration campaign here Sunday.Dr Subramaniam said that the chairman of each branch had been tasked with identifying members who were not yet registered and get them to do so.''As one of their KPI requirements, they have been given until June 15 to complete this task.''They will need to work very hard to achieve the target,'' he said.He said the Indian community must understand how important it is to be able to cast their votes and have a say in the democratic process.''The community must realise that many rights they enjoy … depends greatly on strong political representation. It is important that they give strength to the right party so that their rights are safeguarded,'' he said.Dr Subramaniam added that the Indian community should assist the Government to achieve targets set out in the Malaysian Indian Blueprint.''It can only succeed if there is participation from the community at all levels.""Give the blueprint a chance to succeed and provide an avenue for the upward social mobility of the community,'' he said.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...BEdvd2ZJMQG5.99"
