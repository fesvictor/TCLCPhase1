We only have the copy of the accounts.“It’s clear that they went to her (Kok’s) office to intimidate us, not to do their job. If they are really doing their job, they would go the land office.“I feel that the whole drama is just to dramatise the issue.”The raid followed a series of police reports lodged by Sungai Besar Umno division chief Jamal Md Yunos.The first was filed on March 14, in which Jamal alleged that politicians from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor had taken funds meant for welfare from Yawas instead of disbursing the money to eligible recipients.He identified Kok, who is DAP’s Seputeh MP, DAP’s Sekinchan assemblywoman Ng Suee Lim and a PKR rep whom he did not name as the alleged culprits.Yeo said that the documents Jamal presented to reporters after lodging the report were related to the land and district office.Soon after, Jamal lodged another police report, this time against Yeo, alleging she was involved in misusing the funds.He claimed Yeo had taken money allocated for welfare although no one had passed away. He added that he also had information from beneficiaries who had not received their due allocation.When asked if she expected to have her office raided next, Yeo said she had already informed her staff to prepare all the documents MACC might need. If the anti-graft body came to her office, the documents would handed to them, she said.“We have nothing to hide, they can come. But I will be surprised as I have personally met them last week, to address all the allegations Jamal made.“I’ve also handed over all the related documents to them during the meeting.”http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...er-yawas-funds/"
