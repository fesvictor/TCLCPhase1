No need to pay RM150 a year.   http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...twa-kata-mufti/Kerajaan Pulau Pinang tak sekat fatwa, kata muftiPredeep Nambiar | January 31, 2017Mufti Pulau Pinang mufti berkata fatwa melalui exco kerajaan negeri hanya untuk pemberitahuan sebelum dihantar ke pejabat penasihat undang-undang negeri.muftipenangGEORGE TOWN: Kerajaan Pulau Pinang tidak campur tangan dalam hal berkaitaan fatwa, kata mufti negeri Datuk Wan Salim Wan Mohd Noor.Beliau berkata demikian sebagai respons dakwaan PAS yang semua fatwa terpaksa mendapatkan persetujuan exco kerajaan negeri sebelum diperkenankan Yang di-Pertuan Agong.Beliau berkata fatwa Pulau Pinang dibawa ke majlis mesyuarat kerajaan negeri hanya untuk tujuan “pemberitahuan” sebelum ia dihantar ke pejabat penasihat undang-undang negeri untuk diperbaiki susunan ayatnya.“Ia hanya untuk makluman sahaja. Setakat ini, belum pernah exco menghalang pewartaan fatwa.“Apabila mesyuarat Ahli Jawatankuasa Fatwa Negeri memutuskan untuk mewartakan sesuatu fatwa, maka ia terlebih dahulu dikemukakan ke dalam mesyuarat exco oleh Setiausaha Kerajaan Negeri (SUK).“Ia kemudian dihantar ke pejabat Penasihat Undang-undang Negeri untuk diperbaiki susunan katanya dan selepas itu dihantar ke Istana Negara untuk mendapat perkenan Yang di-Pertuan Agong,” kata Wan Salim.Menurut beliau lagi, selepas ia memperoleh perkenan Yang di-Pertuan Agong, SUK akan menghantarnya ke Pejabat Penasihat Undang-undang Negeri untuk tujuan pewartaan.Semalam, Ketua PAS Pulau Pinang Muhammad Fauzi Yusoff mendakwa kerajaan negeri menapis fatwa dalam Majlis Mesyuarat Kerajaan Negeri yang dipengerusikan ketua menteri.Beliau berkata, dalam keadaan biasa, semua fatwa akan terus kepada Yang di-Pertuan Agong untuk diperkenankan bagi setiap negeri yang tidak mempunyai raja.Pada sidang media yang sama, Ketua Pemuda PAS negeri Hafnan Hamimi Taib Azamudden mendakwa fatwa Pulau Pinang tertakluk kepada penelitian exco kerajaan negeri kerana “kesan ke atas masyarakat umum”, antara lain.Hafnan berkata ini berdasarkan penjelasan dibuat exco negeri yang bertanggungjawab bagi hal ehwal agama, Abdul Malik Abul Kassim dalam mesyuarat Jawatankuasa Fatwa negeri.Hafnan, yang juga bekas anggota Jawatankuasa Fatwa negeri mendakwa exco kerajaan negeri “menangguhkan” beberapa fatwa, sambil menambah langkah itu merendahkan martabat institusi Jawatankuasa Fatwa."

MsGaijin,20170131,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200812,,"IMO, neither the Mufti nor PAS statement can be considered as kantoi.Both statements have their own valid merits and concernsBoth are being reasonable and maybe the only thing to clear this officially is through a civil suit or judicial review, or else it will only end up as an arguments between perceptions. PAS argued that interference by the State Govt took place due to the requirement to present the edicts before the MMKN (which MAY involve scrutiny by the members of the meeting) as explained by the Religious Exco, Abdul Malik Abul Kassim when the supposed procedure requires no such action prior presentation before the YDPA as the Head-of-Islam for Penang.Mufti PP then claimed that the presentations were merely acts to inform the State Govt on the edicts and further stated that the State Govt had never ""freeze"" any edict presented before the MMKN. Thus, I am in the opinion that the situation is being interpreted differently by both sides and I strongly urge a civil suit/ judicial review to clarify on these differences.And as of now, based on the decision by the Court of Appeal in Gov Of Sarawak vs Chong Chien Jien, Fed/ State Govt can sue individual over defamation and until the Federal Court's decision come into fruition, we'll have to be content with the CoA's judgment."
darthboyzzee,20170131,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"Fair enough. But The mufti did not deny the claim that there is ""Fatwa"" that has been frozen and did not forwarded to YDPA. That alone can be consider as ""Campur tangan"".Also DAP still did not answer the other 5 allegation mentioned by PAS which is:1. ISU PERKAMPUNGAN WARISAN MELAYU PULAU PINANG2. TINDAKAN DWI STANDARD TERHADAP PENJAJA MELAYU DAN PENJAJA BUKAN MELAYU3. PROJEK TAMBAK LAUT UNTUK MEWUJUDKAN 3 BUAH PULAU DI TELUK KUMBAR, IMPLIKASI TERHADAP PENDUDUK MELAYU ISLAM5.

But I'm not an exco so take my word as a grain of salt. The Mufti need to explain this more detail and strongly denies the claim by PAS."

Seksyen 48 Enakmen Pentadbiran Agama Islam (Negeri Pulau Pinang) 2004, fatwa tersebut hendaklah terus disyorkan kepada YDPA selaku Ketua Agama Islam di Negeri Pulau Pinang untuk diwartakan, tidak perlu melalui mesyuarat MMK.Kenapa nak di KIV? Fatwa tersebut hanya perlu didengarkan sahaja di mesuarat MMK. Apabila di KIV maka sudah berlaku campur tangan."

MsGaijin,20170131,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200812,,"Indeed there must be a ""decision"" as per CoA's Dato Hisyamudin Yunus, which now begs the question whether a requirement to present the edicts to MMKN before presenting them to YDPA is a ""decision"" by the State which goes against the procedures as stated in Section 48 of the Administration of the Religion of Islam (State of Penang) Enactment 2004 in which allows the YDPA to exercise HRH prerogative right granted by the Fed Consti as the Head of Religion in states without rulers. Order 53 rule 2(4) provides the opportunity to those who are adversely affected by a decision/action/omission in relation to the exercise of a public duty. Did MMKN overstep it boundaries or not? Are the Muslim subjects of YDPA adversely affected by the edict requirement set by MMKN?  Thus in my opinion, wouldn't a judicial review be the better if not the best option to set the record straight?"
gladfly,20170131,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 466,201003,,"Judicial review is the correct procedure  if there is a flaw in the decision making process.  Hence as you have correctly pointed out there must be a decision made before one cN lunch a review. In the absence of any decision there cannot be any review.  Unfortunately the Court doesn't entertain academic questions no matter how important to set the record straight. Even if we take the so called directive to present to fatwa to exco  first as a decision, the time limited to review has already long past as a review must be made within 3 months from the said decision. All in all any attempt to file a judicial review is futile at this stage.  Probably a better way to deal with it is to file a civil suit against the Penang government seeking inter alia  that the act of compelling any fatwa  to be presented to the exco  first is unconstitutional.  Just my 2 cents"

In the press release they said Gordagen is pleased to have secured its intellectual property; that stuck to the back of my mind.  I posted it in one of my threads and then someone reported and it went poof.   It is this thread - https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/4182884 I was wondering what's so special about the post that resulted in its deletion.   Maybe because it was just a press release and wasn't a news report on a court case, hence the complaint against it.  Or maybe it was just one side of the story; the press release might not have told the full story."
