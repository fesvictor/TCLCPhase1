The country is increasingly successful, especially with the National Transformation 2050 (TN50) vision.“Our grandchildren today are still in school and they must have the legacy of Malaysia’s success from this day,” he said at a “Jom Bantu Rakyat” programme and after listening to a briefing on the development of SRJK Tamil Taman Kaya here today.The national blueprint for the Indian community, launched on April 23, was crafted through a comprehensive and inclusive approach to uplift the Malaysian Indian community, especially those in the B40 group (bottom 40% of households with monthly income of RM3,900 and below).The prime minister said he had appointed MIC president Dr S Subramaniam as executive chairman of the MIB with the responsibility of monitoring all programmes for the Indian community.In addition, Najib, who is also BN chairman, said the government practises a policy that any development implemented must be inclusive so that no ethnic groups or individuals are marginalised or left out of mainstream development.“We are also thankful that we live in a country that practises the policy of moderation,” he said.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...t-govt-in-ge14/"
