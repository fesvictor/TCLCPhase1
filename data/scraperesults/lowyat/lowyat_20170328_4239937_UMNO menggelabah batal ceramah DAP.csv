Alasan mereka kononnya program ini ganggu ketenteraman tak masuk akal sebab apa yang DAP buat ini mengikut undang-undang dan prosedur. Kita hantar pemakluman kepada polis.“Mereka tak sedar apa yang mereka buat ini bertentangan dengan prinsip demokrasi!"

danielmckey,20170328,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 367,200801,,"I think it is incorrect title. Why you ask other party to go to your ceramah? It is your own political party talk.It is more likely a debate, unless someone want to join that party.maybe i'm wrong, the UMNO force them to stop the ceramah because they scared."

MsGaijin,20170328,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200812,,"Wow, either you really malas membaca or you're having an acute comprehension problem. Since when DAP Silam asked other party to come to their own political party talk@ceramah? ""LAHAD DATU, 27 MAC: Ceramah pelancaran DAP Silam yang dijadual semalam terpaksa dibatalkan di saat akhir dipercayai akibat tekanan politik ke atas pemilik tanah."" <--- what do you understand from this sentence?But your assumption of UMNGOK stopping the ceramah because they are scared is a reasonable assumption."
