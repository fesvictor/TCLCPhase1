Selepas berada di bawah pemerhatian banyak pihak kerana tindakan Kerajaan Negeri Pulau Pinang yang nampaknya telah bersetuju untuk membayar sepenuhnya untuk Terowong Pulau Pinang yang dicadangkan melalui pertukaran tanah kerajaan tetapi masih memberi pengendali swasta konsesi tol selama 30 tahun pada awal tahun lepas, Ketua Menteri Pulau Pinang ketika itu berkata beliau mahu mengubah terowong kepada jambatan ketiga yang lebih murah.2. Pada bulan Mei 2016, Kerajaan Pulau Pinang kemudiannya telah menulis kepada Kementerian kami untuk meminta kelulusan bagi jambatan ke-3 tanpa memberikan sebarang dokumen sokongan.3. Tidak dapat meneruskan tanpa dokumen sokongan, Kementerian kami telah meminta sebanyak 5 kali pada bulan-bulan berikutnya untuk kajian kemungkinan dan reka bentuk terperinci yang akan memakan kos RM305 juta ke atas Kerajaan Pulau Pinang yang mana sekurang-kurangnya RM135 juta telah dibayar sehingga Mei 2016.4. Pada 6 Ogos 2016, Kerajaan Pulau Pinang mengakui bahawa kajian itu tidak siap sepenuhnya. Mereka telah menyatakan kemudiannya bahawa kajian itu hanyalah 83% siap dan telah berjanji untuk memberi kajian itu kepada Kementerian kami pada awal tahun 2017.5 Hari ini menandakan berakhirnya suku pertama tahun 2017. Kementerian kami ingin memberitahu orang ramai bahawa kami masih belum menerima kajian itu. Oleh itu, kesalahan bagi sebarang kelewatan tidak disebabkan oleh kementerian kami.6. Kementerian kami juga ingin menyatakan kebimbangan tertentu mengenai projek ini dan menawarkan bantuan kepada Kerajaan Negeri Pulau Pinang sekiranya mereka memerlukannya.7. Dilaporkan bahawa kajian ini telah bermula pada lewat tahun 2013. Syarikat konsesi yang telah dianugerahkan projek Terowong Pulau Pinang dan 3 jalan berkaitan sebanyak RM6.34 bilion telah menyatakan pada Januari 2014 bahawa kajian akan siap dan disiarkan kepada orang ramai pada April 2014.Kami menyatakan kebimbangan mengenai kelewatan ini.8. Walaupun Kerajaan Pulau Pinang telah mempertahankan bahawa kos RM305 juta untuk kajian itu adalah munasabah, Kementerian kami percaya kos itu berlebihan dan adalah di luar garis panduan kos yang biasa untuk projek-projek pembinaan seperti ini.9. Kami mempunyai kepakaran untuk melengkapkan kajian itu mengikut masa yang ditetapkan dan pada kos yang lebih rendah. Kami sekali lagi menyatakan kesanggupan kami untuk membantu Kerajaan Negeri Pulau Pinang sekiranya mereka memerlukan bantuan.10. Kita maklum bahawa sekurang-kurangnya RM135 juta telah dibayar oleh Kerajaan Negeri Pulau Pinang untuk kajian itu dan RM2.83 bilion tanah Negeri Pulau Pinang yang ditukar untuk projek ini telah dipra-jual oleh syarikat konsesi terowong itu kepada sebuah syarikat yang tersenarai dalam satu majlis menandatangani perjanjian pada 15 Januari 2016 yang dihadiri oleh Ketua Menteri Pulau Pinang.11. Walaupun pembayaran ini dan pra-penjualan tanah negeri, kami maklum bahawa fasa pertama projek ini pada mulanya dijangka memulakan pembinaan pada awal tahun 2015.12. Sejak 2015, Kerajaan Negeri Pulau Pinang telah kemudiannya menyemak semula garis masa beberapa kali dengan memetik pelbagai sebab.13. Baru-baru ini, ahli EXCO Pulau Pinang yang bertanggungjawab bagi infrastruktur itu kini berkata bahawa fasa pertama projek itu hanya dijangka memulakan pembinaan pada masa yang paling awal adalah pada pertengahan tahun 2018.14. Kementerian kami terus menyatakan kebimbangan kami mengenai pelbagai kelewatan, kos kajian dan kos projek ini.Dato’ Sri Haji Fadillah Bin Haji Yusof,Menteri Kerja RayaMarch 30, 2017--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TLDR Version:2017 Q1 already finished..where's the feasibility studies that DAP promised? seriously want to build or not?"

We do know however, that the government’s own appointed consultants, HSS Integrated, has estimated that the cost of the 600km railway project will be less than RM30 billion....Worse, only 30 percent of the project will involve local companies and contractors, despite an abundance of experience and expertise which are already widely available in Malaysia.[/I]"

Haven't it ever occur to you DAP is at the greater risk if proven, they're found to be really wasting Penang State Money (aka Weak Project Management) or siphon in corruption for that matter?Haven't it ever occur to you DAP is the under dog that needed to prove itself since they know pretty well they're under your watchful eyes? They have a lot more to lose, hence they are always on their toes.With that being said, I don't think it's weak project management, Haven't it made more sense to you the delay has more to do with lack of funds rather than weak project management?Penang isn't like central Govt where they have more money.I don't really care if you want to emulate whatever opposition is doing.

Faidzal,20170330,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 234,200808,From: From JB to KL!,"TS bodo TL; DR version yang TS post pun incomplete/half-truth.from what I understand from this menteri kerja raya statement:1. penang state govt. want to pay for tunnel project fully using penang state govt. money. money is sourced from selling penang state govt. land and 30 year concession to project developer. estimated cost of project =  RM6.34 billion2. but then penang govt. changed mind, so cancel tunnel project and change to 3rd bridge project.3. however any public works project must go thru public works dept. for approval.4. penang state govt. asked to change project (from tunnel to bridge) approval but didn't submit supporting docs (feasibility study etc.).5. JKR estimate the feasibility study and detailed design works would cost RM305 mill., of which penang state already paid RM135 mill. to project developer (concessionaire) along with the sale of state govt. land worth RM2.83 billion which in turn developer/concessionaire flipped to another listed company.6. feasibility study only 83% completed as claimed by penang state govt. but they claim they will submit by 2017.7. it's already end of 1st quarter 2017 but still no feasibility study received by kementerian...TL; DR penang state govt. paid RM135 mill (NOT RM305 million) for feasibility study, so technically penang state govt. yet to finish payment.so how can you expect study to finish if payment not fully paid?study completed until 83% but payment not even reached 50%....ok, maybe penang state govt. have problem, and maybe their ego too high to come back to federal JKR to ask for help.but if this minister thinks there's wrong doing, why didn't he go and report to MACC?"
