We were all present! I was sitting in the Dewan throughout!“He accused us of failing to protest against the motion. Lim Kit Siang and Gobind Singh Deo fought extensively with the Speaker on why the tabling was allowed in the first place!“Guess what, it was the Cabinet, yes, a Cabinet made up of MCA donkeys who agreed to the tabling!” Pua said in a strongly-worded statement today.Pua, who is also DAP national publicity secretary, said DAP had already lined up Gobind (Puchong MP) and Mohd Ariff Sabri (Raub MP) to debate Hadi’s bill, but were never given the chance.“Why is that? Because the Speaker colluded with the Cabinet to stop the motion from being debated by adjourning the Parliamentary sitting!” Pua said.He was referring to the events in the Dewan Rakyat on Thursday afternoon, with Speaker Pandikar Amin Mulia adjourning the session and deferring the debate on Hadi’s bill to the next parliamentary sitting in July.“Can you get more ridiculous than that? BN (that’s including MCA) allowed PAS to table the Act 355 amendments, then the Speaker, who is from Umno, stops the sitting after the amendments were tabled in order to deny a chance for us to debate (and of course, protest) the Bill!“And that bloody liar Wee Ka Siong has the cheek to accuse the DAP, saying we ‘didn’t object to Bill’!” Pua said before challenging Wee to sue him for defamation.Yesterday, Pua’s DAP colleague Teresa Kok, who is Seputeh MP, also slammed Wee, the Ayer Hitam MP, calling the accusations “irresponsible and baseless”."
