Not Noor Haslina,"" Nor Maiza said at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur today.Noraihan was married to the late Muhamad Zamly Abdullah, the elder brother of Bahri's wife, Noor Haslina.On Jan 20 this year, Noraihan claimed that Bahri had abused him powers and instructed a team from his division to raid her house in January last year, when he was still the special operations division director at MACC.Noraihan, the director of Kolej Islam Sains dan Teknologi (Kist), which was previously owned by her late husband, had claimed that documents related to her college and other businesses were confiscated.Muhamad Zamly passed away in September 2015, leaving behind assets worth RM100 million and debts amounting to RM85 million, according to Noraihan."
