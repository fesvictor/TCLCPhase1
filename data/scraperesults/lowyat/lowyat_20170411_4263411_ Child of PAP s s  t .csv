TGHA Quote of the year IMO   .'Child of PAP's s**t' – Hadi's crude salvo against DAPPAS president Abdul Hadi Awang did not mince words in describing the origins of DAP during a speech in Terengganu last night.“…PAP (People's Action Party) rules Singapore. Singapore was once in Malaysia, there was a PAP branch in Malaysia. When Singapore exited Malaysia, PAP changed to DAP (in Malaysia).“So DAP is 'anak butir taik PAP' (a child from PAP's excrement). This is to say it in crude language,” he added in his parliament constituency of Marang.https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/378764#ixzz4dvYxITZm"
