A few died after being hit by runaway underage rempits/bikers when they evade roadblocks.  I fear the first line of defense  (aka parents intervention)  is non existent as they tidak apa the kids action. some even GROOM THEIR KIDS to ride early so can help do chores /ride to kedai runcit buy stuff or to distract younger siblings ( circus show 1 bike 4 kiddos) around kampung roads , luring em out in the wild so parents can have sexy time to produce more kids."

LamboSama,20170330,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,201108,,Accidents happen. Adults also get into accidents.Driving without a license is wrong no doubt.But doesn't mean it was the cause of the accident.Police doesn't charge people. At most they can give summons.And charging people means burden of proof and court time.All not within PDRM jurisdiction.
