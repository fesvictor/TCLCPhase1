Azmin said this when responding to questions on why there were no Pakatan Harapan (PH) members in the Selangor administration.In Georgetown, DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said he would issue a detailed statement on the matter today. The Penang Chief Minister said he wanted to check all the facts before making any statement as to whether PR state government still existed in Selangor.He, however, stated that as far as Penang was concerned, PR had ceased to exist and that the current state government was made up of PH.“There is no Pakatan Rakyat anymore. I will comment more later,” he said after attending Penang Development Corporation’s Hari Raya open house here yesterday.Azmin’s spokesperson Ginie Lim, meanwhile, clarified that the PR state government still existed based on the mandate from the 13th general elections.“Parti Amanah Negara is a member of the PH political coalition.“But in terms of state administration, the working relationship between all the parties that were given the mandate in the last election remains,” she said, adding this was what Azmin was trying to explain when he made the statement.She said the main priority was the consensus among all the Opposition parties, at both the state and national levels.The PR political coalition consisted of DAP, PAS and PKR, but it was dissolved in July 2015 following the fallout between PAS and DAP.Recently, the PAS syura council decided to also cut political ties with PKR, but in Selangor, the two parties maintain their relation to allow the three PAS assemblymen to continue as state executive councillors until the next election.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...2U01bZdwF222.99"

Rakyat already casted their votes so they can't complain.Also...PAS supporters voted for DAP. DAP supporters voted for PAS because of DAP.#wakeup#learntheconstitution#deathtoPR#DAPisprincipled#PASisstupid

MIC and MCA and S&S party got what disagree? now they gonna fight for more devolution from federal powers.. Still want to discuss behind close door? the ppl there all fed up and now pushing their state goh men to take back their rights.. the party now have to be seen as fighting the federal power.. otherwise they'd be kicked out in the next election.. they are even sending a team to the UK to relook at the MA63.. so u still think BN formula of discuss behind close door still work?
