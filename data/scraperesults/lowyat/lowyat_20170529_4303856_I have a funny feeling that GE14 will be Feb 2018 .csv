~Sherlock~,20170529,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 39,201010,,it will coincide with Chinese new year. then the Chinese will make noise and the Malays will tell Chinese to respect perlembagaan of the country. such friction will make Malays unite behind UMNO.actually more like bulan kempen is feb 2018 then real election somewhere in march 2018.

RobUlstan,20170529,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 89,201012,,Why would the Chinese complain? And why would Malays tell Chinese to respect perlembagaan? If it affects the holidays both side will also complain.

U need to wait for the old gooks to die b4 the young people take over. Old gooks still make up majority of the voters and ayam sure 99% on lyn is not even voters.Even so the 1% that has voting rights ok /k majority of them actually lurkig here and will vote bn anytime.True storeyz.
