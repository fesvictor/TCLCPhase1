The state government cannot do this kind of contracts.”He said those unhappy with the price of the land sold can complain to the finance minister as the land was sold at higher than the government valuation price.The deal has come under the spotlight of the Penang opposition after it was sold through direct negotiations instead of open tender, as is usually done by the state government.Lim defended the sale, saying it would bring RM2-RM7 billion in economic value to the state, creating 2,000 jobs and wooing medical talent from overseas.The land was sold to Island Hospital Sdn Bhd on a 99-year-lease last December. The hospital intends to build a 600-bed private hospital and suites in the next five years if it obtains a medical licence from the health ministry in the next two years.The hospital has placed RM30 million as downpayment.If it fails to obtain the ministry licence, it will forfeit 2% of the payment and the land will remain under Penang government’s ownership.Lim had said the land was sold higher than the finance ministry’s valuation of RM148 million for a 99-year-lease. The Valuation Department had recommended that the land be sold at RM156 million if the buyer sought a freehold title.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...e-man-decision/"
