Malaysia’s relationship with the United States, China, India and Arab Saudi, among others, remained strong under ‘Najiblomatic’, he said.“Najib had also strengthened Umno, making it more stable, strong and organised than before. This has improved solidarity among Barisan Nasional members.“We hope the country will continue to improve towards a becoming a successful nation.”http://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/04/...efited-malaysia"
