Perfect.Stranger,20170326,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 27,201604,,Nothing wrong to use the name...Niz aziz serves the people of kelantan..But need to know what amanah intention in the event
lepo,20170326,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 330,200607,,"Amanah is wrong here using aTGNA as their milestone. They should consult with the wife late aTGNA before doing anything. Show letter that aTGNA wife or family agreed their aTGNA can be use in their event. If aTGNA was an artist, sure Amanah got sue straight away. You guys never heard about image copyright ka?"

bugijun,20170326,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 500,200605,From: Seremban,So amanah try to imply that if tgna still alive he will join amanah? Wake up man and think of a better aproach....
joe_mamak,20170326,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,Wait for the seminar lah.  Maybe it is going to be a positive one.
trix,20170326,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 562,200502,"From: everywhere, yet nowhere.",So he is effectively saying that nik aziz all these while fight for pas and not islam?Ok
LamboSama,20170326,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,201108,,Either positive or negative. It is disrespectful to use the identity or name of a person who has passed away without agreement for their family.
funnybone,20170326,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 958,200812,,"Amanah members are more aligned with his late father's political struggles than him.....it was him a disgrace to his family for standing side by side with the biggest corrupted devil, UMNO"
joe_mamak,20170326,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,I don't think so.  What if they heap praises on the deceased?

lepo,20170326,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 330,200607,,"Joe, let aTGNA R.I.P and why still PAN want to use his name. ATGNA never left PAS and why PAN is very langsi to using dead people name? This sure is for political gain, PAN is politic party and not ngo."
joe_mamak,20170326,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"I am keeping an open mind lah, as always. Seminar title only.  We don't know what is in the seminar.  TGNA never left PAS, that's true.  But Amanah only came about after he passed away.  Some of the people in Amanah probably held him in high esteem.Would they besmirch his name for political gain?  Like I said, I am keeping an open mind."
