And where it's only natural to expect that such high-level position comes with huge responsibility.Opposition politicians and many others have been saying the blueprint is a political ploy to garner votes from the Indian community.Their ballot papers are crucial this election, where three-cornered fights are expected in many constituencies.Our observations created an uproar from the ruling party politicians, particularly those from the MIC.They also felt offended and rather upset that we had negated their role in the document, which promises to find durable solutions to Indian woes after six decades.BN loss won’t affect blueprintSEDIC director-general NS Rajendran was frothing at his mouth, shocked that we refused to see the pure intentions behind this initiative.But Najib's statement clearly indicates that it's business as usual for the Umno-led BN government, where any issue can be leveraged upon in attempt to win the next election, described as a tough one given the negative publicity courted by the prime minister.So the end story is that Malaysian Indians don't really matter.If Najib is serious about uplifting the socio-economic status of the Indians and solving matters related to statelessness, he would concentrate on said issues.Surely we don't need to remind the premier that the blueprint can be implemented by the next government in power. Or do we?CHARLES SANTIAGO (DAP) is Klang MP, XAVIER JAYAKUMAR (PKR) is Sri Andalas assemblyperson.The views expressed here are those of the author/contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of Malaysiakini."
