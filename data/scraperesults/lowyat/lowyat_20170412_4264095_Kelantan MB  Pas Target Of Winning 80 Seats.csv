The target is not specific yet.""As we all know, we need all the strength we can get before we can contest (in the GE14). Maybe it was only an initial statement.""We will see (how things develop),"" he told reporters after attending the East Coast Economic Council Meeting with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak here, today.Ahmad was responding to a statement by Pas vice-president Idris Ahmad, who recently said that the party aims to win 80 seats in the GE14. Idris added that party members have presented a range of proposals to Pas’ top leadership, including new seats to be contested in the GE14.On Pas-PKR ties, Ahmad, who is also Pas deputy spiritual adviser, said maintaining cooperation depends on the party's leadership.""It is up to the Pas representatives. This is a big issue, so we will leave it to the muktamar,"" he said.On another matter, Ahmad condemned Chinese daily Nanyang Siang Pau’s cartoon, which depicts Pas president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang and Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Pandikar Amin Mulia as monkeys.He described the illustration as “rude and brings bad culture” to the people.https://sg.news.yahoo.com/pas-target-winnin...-113919117.html"
