ironmaid89,20170131,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"Gerakan’s lion presenting the peeled fruit to Prime Minister Najib RazakGerakan Youth chief Tan Keng Liang schools pro-opposition supporters on the Chinese New Year (CNY) tradition when they claimed the lion dancers refused to put an act for Prime Minister Najib Razak and his wife Rosmah Mansor.He was hitting on the critics for viralling part of a video showing the lion refused to dance in front of Prime Minister Najib and his wife during the Gerakan Chinese New Year Open house in Kuala Lumpur.Posting on his Facebook, he said that “It is CNY tradition where the lion dancer presents pomelo to special guests as a symbol to bring prosperity.“In fact, the lion dancer was peeling pomelo and oranges for Najib and his wife.“It is unfortunate that some people choose to twist and fabricate lies towards the lion dancers who performed professionally.“Even Najib personally praised the lion dancers in his Facebook posting.”He added that there are some irresponsible spins claiming the lion dancer refuses to perform in front of Prime Minister Najib.“None of the performers are superman. I doubt anyone could have peeled a pomelo and orange in less than 30 seconds.“It is unfortunate that some people choose to twist and fabricate lies towards the lion dancers who performed professionally.“If those pro-opposition people can’t understand the Chinese tradition during CNY lion dance performance then please don’t try to tarnish and insult the tradition.”http://www.malaysiaoutlook.com/gerakan-you...on-dance-video/"
