Simi said several documents and credit cards were seized by the MACC to assist in the probe.The suspect will be taken to the court for a remand order today.MAHB, in a statement last night, said: “We have been made aware through various media reports on the arrest made by MACC on one of our employees.“Malaysia Airports had given full co-operation to MACC on this investigation and will continue to do so until it is concluded.”Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...ltAXMbVtWWBb.99"
