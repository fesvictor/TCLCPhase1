Sirmacai,20170726,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 213,201604,,everything they must blame najib/hadi. Najib/hadi did nothing must blame them also. When lks party report him for corruption he blame najib/hadi. When lks son ada problem he blame najib/hadi. This kit siang really bodo patut la he cannot win anything and is a failure in life. He lead his party to failure and all his friends also become losers + failure in life.
