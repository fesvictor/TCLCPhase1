joe_mamak,20170413,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,I looked at some news report.  More or less his claim was that MACC had traced some funds from 1MDB to someone close to the PAS leadership.But of course he asked Hadi/PAS to deny it.

azhan82,20170413,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 240,201505,From: Klang Valley,"Zzz...after reading some comment, i wonder where people get their sources from...“On Jan 28, 2017, I met a former senior leader of MACC, who had led the probe on 1MDB and Najib’s involvement in the scandal,” the Pandan MP told a press conference aired on Facebook live today.“We shared information and knowledge about 1MDB… and he spoke about how MACC in its investigation, found that some of the amount channeled from SRC International to the prime minister’s personal account, were then transfered Nasharudin.”He also alleged that the former senior MACC officer had spoken of the time Kuala Nerus PAS MP Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali had met him to inquire about the investigation on 1MDB.According to Rafizi, the officer had told him everything there is to know about the investigation, but Khairuddin had not said a word about it.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...its-nasharudin/since Nasharuddin got kicked out of PAS in 2013, and money went into Bijan account around 2011 to 2013..safely can assume money did go into PAS leadership. Unless Rafizi can prove that money went further to current PAS leadership, rafizi is just barking at the hill...Side note, Where do people get their information from regarding Nasharuddin joining PAN?"
