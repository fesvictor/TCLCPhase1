They have demanded that Dr Mahathir apologise to Anwar, his family and the Otai Reformis group to show that he is sincere.This group still regard the newly installed Pakatan chairman as the “syaitan” (Satan) and mother of all Pharoahs because they often compare his sacking and imprisonment of Anwar to the cruelty of the Pharoahs.“I am facing a spectrum of emotions in our group. My role is to breach the gap and to convince them that the aim is to win the general election,” said Saari who was twice detained under the Internal Security Act during the Mahathir era.The Otai Reformis group was formed during the Reformasi movement after the Anwar sacking. It became very active again after Dr Mahathir crossed over to Pakatan.They had booed and jeered at Dr Mahathir when he addressed them at a convention in Shah Alam earlier this year.Saari, who has been with Anwar since the 1970s, admitted that he also feels conflicted by the latest development.“The story is not so beautiful if Anwar has to become PM only by cooperating with Mahathir. I support the leadership but I hope we will not be cheated again”"
