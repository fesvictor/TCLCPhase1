nikita zuleica,20170310,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 402,201008,,"*MEDIA BERAT SEBELAH*Berita penangkapan 6 orang di atas tuduhan salah guna kuasa dan rasuah oleh SPRM ternyata amat berat sebelah apabila ‘anak exco’ dan ‘pegawai khas exco’ diberí penekanan yang lebih berbanding 4 orang yang lain iaitu 2 orang pemaju, 1 orang peguam, dan 1 orang awam. Media mengambil kesempatan dengan tajuk ‘anak exco’ walaupun ‘anak exco’ itu yang baru berusia 25 tahun belum tentu menjadi ‘prime suspect’ dalam kes tersebut. ‘Anak exco’ yang disebut-sebut adalah Ahmad Fauzan bin Datuk Abd Latif Bandi. Beliau merupakan pengarah syarikat Alaf Penta Waris Sdn Bhd (dahulunya dikenali dengan nama Bandi Bina Sdn Bhd). Alaf Penta Waris Sdn Bhd adalah syarikat warisan daripada datuk beliau yang seterusnya dimajukan oleh YB Datuk Abdul Latif Bandi. Syarikat ini merupakan syarikat yang mempunyai status lesen G7 iaitu syarikat yang boleh melakukan projek pembinaan yang bernilai RM10 juta dan ke atas sahaja. Isu Ahmad Fauzan mempunyai gaya hidup yang mewah tidak seharusnya dijadikan mainan politik kerana atas kapisiti syarikat yang beliau uruskan seharusnya tiada pertikaian kemampuan kehidupan beliau.YB Datuk Ahmad Latif Bandi juga merupakan Bendahari Kehormat Persatuan Bolasepak Negeri Johor (PBNJ) yang merupakan satu organisasi yang sangat dipandang tinggi oleh rakyat Johor. Lihat sahaja beliau menguruskan kewangan PBNJ sudah cukup membuktikan kredebiliti beliau dalam tadbir urus yang cemerlang. Mana mungkin TMJ telah memilih orang yang silap dalam menguruskan kewangan us."
