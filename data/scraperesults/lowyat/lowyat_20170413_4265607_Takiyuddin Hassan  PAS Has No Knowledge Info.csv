PAS cannot be implicated in this issue,” he said in a statement on Thursday.Earlier Thursday, PKR vice-president Rafizi Ramli had alleged in a statutory declaration (SD) that Nasharudin received funds from SRC International Sdn Bhd, a former 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) subsidiary.Rafizi claimed to have received his information from an unnamed former senior officer of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) who had led the 1MDB investigation, and who has since retired.Takiyuddin, also the Kota Baru MP, said PAS would leave it to the authorities to investigate Rafizi’s SD.However, he added the allegation is merely hearsay unless the individual who is the source of the information comes forward to back his claims.Nasharudin is now chief executive officer of the Global Movement of Moderates. He was Yan MP from 1999 to 2004 and Bachok MP from 2008 to 2013. He was PAS deputy president from 2005 to 2011.He was also a key proponent of the “unity government plan” with Umno, an idea that was eventually scuttled.He was dropped from the Ulamak Syura Council in 2013 for allegedly going against several council decisions.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...0J160e2fUy8r.99"
