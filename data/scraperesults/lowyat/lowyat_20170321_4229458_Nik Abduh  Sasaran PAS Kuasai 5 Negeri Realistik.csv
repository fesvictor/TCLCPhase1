Oleh kerana politik yang ada sekarang sudah berbeza dan tidak sama lagi dengan pilihan raya umum lalu, jadi kita membuat sasaran sendiri tanpa melibatkan mana-mana pihak,” katanya ketika ditemui di sini hari ini.Presiden Pas, Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang dalam satu ucapannya yang tersebar luas di media sosial pernah mengeluarkan kenyataan bahawa parti itu meletakkan sasaran menguasai lima negeri iaitu Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah, Perak serta Selangor dan selebihnya kepada UMNO.Bagaimanapun dalam sidang akhbar selepas menyampaikan ucaptama dalam Konvensyen Profesional Malaysia anjuran Dewan Pemuda Pas Pusat di Cyberjaya Sabtu lalu Abdul Hadi menafikan pernah mengeluarkan kenyataan tersebut.Ahli Parlimen Marang itu dilaporkan berkata, tidak pernah wujud kerjasama Pas dan BN untuk mengagihkan beberapa negeri antara kedua-dua parti tersebut.Sementara itu, Nik Mohamad Abduh menafikan dakwaan kononnya Pas mempunyai pakatan dengan BN sebaliknya sasaran tersebut adalah berdasarkan kemampuan parti itu sendiri.“Ini sasaran kita yang dibuat oleh Pas Pusat, (dipersetujui) di semua peringkat dan negeri,” katanya. - UTUSAN ONLINEhttp://www.utusan.com.my/berita/politik/ku...7#ixzz4bun5rqlv"
