Slowpokeking,20170425,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201410,,Doesn't add up though. If cut taxes where would the money come from?Besides. I want less free stuffs. I'm content with small government with less powers instead of one that is prone to be abused by those that has easy way to power by promising free stuffs.

Even, 12% - 15% would not be surprise, seeing the gov now needs money so 'badly' to pay it's creditors!"
joe_mamak,20170425,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,Some free stuff is needed by the poor folks.  Of course it doesn't add up.  I suppose a PH government would have to continue chalking up more debts until the whole system is revamped.

blanket84,20170425,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 541,200805,,This is kinda stupid. GST is the best form of tax. If they wanted to help the poor just extend the list of exempted goods.

Noyoudontcare,20170425,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 155,200807,,Lol Malaysia will be aging society.  More $$$ needed to to fund education healthcare etc. So you want to depend on fossil fuels forever while other countries are going green? Well either reduce gst and increase income tax like other developed countries.Add: what makes Malaysia so special that most countries in the world have gst/vat for so long and we are thinking of abolishing it? Got 1 billion tonnes gold underneath selangor? They expect malaysians companies to be profitable like Apple in 10 years and contribute24% of their taxes to gov?
