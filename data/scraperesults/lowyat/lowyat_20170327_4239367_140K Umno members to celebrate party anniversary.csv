Executive secretary Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Yusoh (pix) told a media briefing Monday that the gathering will be attended by party president Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, vice-president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and all other senior party members.  “The highlight of the Umno anniversary celebration this year will be to show that this party will still remain united under Barisan Nasional to face the next general election.  “It will also show that unity in Barisan Nasional is still solid under the leadership of Datuk Seri Najib,” Rauf said.  One of the highlights of the gathering that starts at 7pm will be a live telecast from the Putra World Trade Centre (PWTC).  The live telecast will show the groundbreaking ceremony for Umno’s new party headquarters that will be housed in a 70-storey tower built near the site of the current PWTC.  Various activities will be organised in the run-up to the gathering at the stadium.  They include a party flag run (larian bendera), an essay writing and drawing competition on the 2050 National Transformation (TN50) aspiration, and a two-day carnival on May 10 and May 11 outside the National Stadium.-----------------------------------Happy Birthday.  And motorists please take note."
