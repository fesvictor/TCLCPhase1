(Somewhere, the President of the United States is nodding proudly.) The groups were all fed the same amount of food. By the end of it, the mice in the first two groups had gained a ton of weight, but those in that last lucky cohort—eating the same fast food as their plus-size counterparts—gained only about 10 percent of their body weight. Even more impressively, already-obese mice whose olfactory senses were temporarily disabled quietly returned to normal size without changing their diet."
