I live in Segambut area which includes Bkt Maluri, Manjalara and DPC , and is definitely a lot more affluent compared to kepong Baru/Jinjang. Anything north of MRR2 is Batu constituency. So when ppl saying Kepong area they dont necessary mean DPC or Bkt Maluri."

Given a choice between maintaining current pace vs more development but with higher GST, most will prefer the former.Kepong is considered a residential area. And as a residential area, it is alright. There's no high class malls or tonnes of train stations but we still have fast internet and they're building lots of roads there. Besides, everything else is a stone's throw away. Unlike rural areas where they remain undeveloped and the next best area are so far away."
