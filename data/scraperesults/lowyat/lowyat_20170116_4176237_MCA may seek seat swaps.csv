We have lost two terms (in Penang) and we need to accept the fact that if we have seats, but the candidates from any other BN component parties are stronger, then we should acknowledge them and give our support to the candidates.""And, if there were seats held by another component party, but our candidates seem stronger in those constituencies, then we may persuade them (component parties) to give our candidates a chance to compete.""In the 13th general election, Penang MCA lost in all of its 10 state seats and four Parliamentary seats contested."
