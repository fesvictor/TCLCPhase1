Do our votes mean nothing to them?” he said. Representatives from 600 taxi driver associations attended the assembly, which involved members from every state, except Sabah and Sarawak.Meanwhile, Zailani also urged all taxi associations to unite and create a single organisation through which taxi drivers’ concerns can be channelled to the authorities.“There are a lot of taxi associations in Malaysia. We are hoping that all can work under one roof,” he said.teksiIn March, taxi operators and drivers gathered to protest against the Uber and Grab e-hailing services in front of the Parliament building after submitting three memorandums.Approximately 200 drivers came and protested, occupying the pedestrian path on the left and right side of the bridge leading to the Parliament building main gate.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...drivers-ask-bn/"
