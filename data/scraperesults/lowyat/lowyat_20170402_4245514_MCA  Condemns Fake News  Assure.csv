This is a lie with bad intentions. The creator of this slander is playing a trick to create chaos,"" said MCA deputy president Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong on Twitter.Dr Wee called for the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission to investigate the spread of the slanderous news on social media.He also pointed out that MCA president Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai is currently in India as part of the Malaysian delegation with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak.The fake article was written in the form of an actual newspiece and quoted Liow as well as Tourism and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz, among others.It claimed that this was the ""biggest political development in Malaysia"", adding that Liow had disclosed the news to reporters after a ""quarterly MCA Central Committee meeting"".However, the fake article had several spelling and factual mistakes, as well as the questionable byline ""Neo Tar Pean"", which means ""you have faeces"" in Mandarin.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...E6kjAYLOgFj6.99"
