frossonice,20170228,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 73,200806,,"It would be Zahid Hamidi. Unless some people in UMNO decided against it and name someone else. It is all in the hand of UMNO (BN) now as ruling political party. I think that is the strength of BN as a coalition party. They already agreed upon who will be PM/DPM/which ministers belong to with component parties and so on. In essence, they already have a succession plan lay out plainly among them. As unequal as it may look (with UMNO having the lion share of ministries + PM/DPM from them too), it somehow create a content coalition.And that is the problem with Pakatan Harapan or any other opposition coalitions. At any given time, they will always squabble for positions. Every single one of the want to be PM regardless of how big the party is. There is no succession plan to show only separate talk and claims among each other. They opt to destabilize the coalition first rather than coming to common senses. Opposition coalition will always fail unless they can come out with concrete succession plan than can stay true to it form for at least 5 year (one election rotation). People will see it as valid alternative to BN if that happen."

MilitaryMadness,20170228,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201010,From: Over your shoulder,"Pipul forget already Zahid was one time very close to Anwar (he was a former student of Anwar's father, Haji Ibrahim). He was then openly critical on Mahathir's rule and firmly in Anwar's Reformasi camp until he was arrested and held under ISA. His daughter claimed when he was released in 1999, plainclothes police simply abandoned him, still blindfolded, at the side of the PLUS highway.Also, did you know he had a chinese foster father when he was small?The son of Zahid Hamidi's foster father, Chen Yong Zhong (above), shows a photo of his late father. He said of Zahid: Ahmad Zahid seemed to be quite congenial with his father, Zahid liked to help his father and both of them had built up close relationship.When asked about how Ahmad Zahid called his father “bapa angkat”, Cheng Yong Zhong said he was not sure about this, but he believed that Ahmad Zahid called his father “Ah Ting”, but when talking to outsiders he would address him as foster father, and his father had never rejected the title.Even though the story happened half a century ago, and his father had passed away, Chen Yong Zhong felt that it was a warm and interesting memory, at least now that the residents around Simpang Tiga would remember Chen Jin Ting when someone mentioned about Ahmad Zahid’s foster father.sos"
