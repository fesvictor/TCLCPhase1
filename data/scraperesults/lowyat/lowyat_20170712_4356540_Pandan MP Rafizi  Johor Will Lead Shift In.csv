After all, the coalition’s name is Pakatan Harapan,” he said when contacted.Segamat Umno chief Zahari Sarip said the PKR veep was just creating propaganda to boost support on the ground.However, he said Segamat Umno would take the claims as a reminder to work harder in the lead-up to the general election.Rafizi said he had not forgotten the good work done by past Umno leaders, many of whom came from Johor.“However, despite former Umno leaders having served the people well, I also can’t ignore the misdeeds of the current leadership in the (Prime Minister) Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s administration,” he said.Rafizi said he was not surprised by the reactions of Anuar and Zahari, but he remained confident that Sekijang and Segamat, which is held by MIC president and health minister Dr S Subramaniam, would fall to the opposition in GE14.He pointed out that the pressure of low wages, influx of foreign workers which deprived locals of job opportunities and the rising cost of living due to the goods and services tax (GST) were all products of BN policies.“In fact, the GST champion who became the butt of jokes throughout the country is a Johor leader, that is Datuk Ahmad Maslan,” he added.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...support-for-ph/"
