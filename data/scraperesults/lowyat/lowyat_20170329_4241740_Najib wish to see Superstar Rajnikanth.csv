Meeting the chief minister? Meeting the governor, even one with additional charge from Maharashtra, as at present? Meeting M. Karunanidhi, the tallest living Tamil politician?None of these. For Malaysia's Prime Minister Dato' Sri Mohammad Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak, who arrives here on Thursday on a two-day visit before going to New Delhi to break bread with his counterpart Narendra Modi, the ultimate priority is meeting Tamil actor Rajinikanth.Najib Razak, as the Prime Minister is commonly known, and his wife Datin Paduka Seri Rosmah Mansor have put in a request for meeting the actor whose 2016 blockbuster Kabali was shot almost entirely in Malaysia with only a few scenes in Chennai, Hong Kong and Bangkok. Malaysia's first couple became Rajinikanth fans during the actor's long stay in Malacca for the production of Kabali.But the Tamil icon, whose Malaysia-shot film was a huge box office hit, is acting coy. He has not yet agreed to Kuala Lumpur's request. Hopeful of a confirmation from Rajinikanth in the next two days, Malaysian diplomats in Chennai have kept a slot free on the first couple's itinerary on Friday morning, according to a minute-to-minute programme of the VVIP visitors shown to The Telegraph.sos"
