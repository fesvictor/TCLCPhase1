~Sherlock~,"  Jul 11 2017, 02:17 PM",New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 39,Joined: Oct 2010,,Sambung bayar a little different than pajak kereta. sambung bayar is person A take loan but person B pay loan and use car.pajak kereta is 'investors' aka owner enter agreement with a company to allow this company to use their names to apply for bank loan and in return they get back some money.

~Sherlock~,"  Jul 11 2017, 02:35 PM",New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 39,Joined: Oct 2010,,"Pajak company agree to pay downpayment and monthly installment for 'investors'. however the bank loan is under the investor name. pajak company will try to rent out cars at a higher premium so that the investors can get their profit. example is like this.Saga BLM is RM40kpajak kereta will pay Rm4k DP and monthly installment of around RM300/month. the pajak kereta will then rent this car out at RM500 so that the investor can get a profit of rm200. however, the bank loan must be under the investors name.all is well if there is constant rental. however problem arises if there isn't.like in this case, the pajak kereta did not pay the monthly installments, so the investors name busuk in ctos/ccris and they use force to get back the cars. now the thing is, this isn't really fair for the pajak kereta who put the DP right?"

Imp Bron,"  Jul 11 2017, 03:19 PM",New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 35,Joined: Aug 2014,,"They just robbed back their own property that is inside robber's private property. Kereta Pajak is an investment method, you give your IC and detail to Syarikat Sewa Kereta, then they use your detail to take a loan under your name to buy the car. They then use your car for sewa kerata business and promised to pay the car loan for you. After 5 years or so when the car is unfit to rent, they will give back the car to you. So you get your car after 5 years being used by the Car Rent company at a cheaper price. Its like buy 2nd hand car but using your own name at cheaper price.The case here is the Car Rent company probably nonexistent, they use investors name to buy cars and they don't pay the bank like they promised. The car loan already due to 7month, so the car will be confiscated by the bank later. So investor left with unpaid car loan under their name and doesn't get anything, and the car will be confiscated by the bank. Owner feels cheated and gang up to take back their car that is under their name."
