I'm now in my 50's, way past my youthful years and I seriously don't give a rat's arse anymore."

silic0sis,20170418,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,200508,,"A large part of the reason is that there aren't many situations to use it, so people start to lose fluency. The only time you use Malay is when dealing with government, police or ordering food and you only need minimal fluency to convey what you need to in those cases.The thing with language is you have to actually use it to retain fluency, so it's one thing to say all Malaysians should be fluent in BM, but how exactly do you make that happen?"

I sometime use casual malay to start a conversation with chinese staff at the mall (While I'm browsing goods) most of them don't even understand or rather don't know how to reply in malay.. then I just use english and everything back to normal
silic0sis,20170418,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,200508,,"Hm, personally I've never met a Malaysian who studied in Malaysia who can't speak basic Malay, except old folks, or those who studied in international school.It's quite rare I think, since we learn it in school and you have to pass it for SPM. I guess for some, the lack of practice makes it hard to string full sentences together since you get stuck trying to remember certain words. My fluency is quite bad now although I was an A student in BM. My written BM was decent, and I wrote with the same degree of proficiency as I did with English, but I can probably only write at doraemon comic level now lol. Sometimes it's hard to talk to malays too because malays use a more casual form of speaking which can be quite different what we learn in school, although often they try to accommodate and speak in an easier to understand manner."

Those siam school got ofter Bahasa Malaysia and Mandarin subject. The older people i met at that kampung can speak malay like Malaysian malay, but the kids can't cause they don't want to learn it. \If Malaysia retain these culture why not...I have lots of friend doesn't want to take Mandarin in SMK. Everyone get same benefit, to learn or speak what language, choose yourself."
