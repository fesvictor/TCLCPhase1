Are you guys too expecting too much of your government?"

Economists generally agree that in the long run, inflation is caused by increases in the money supply.When government increases government debt and spend, this will increases the money supply in the market. If the spent money is on productivity generating projects, the corresponding increase in productivity will keep currency value stable. If it was on mega project without any generating any real value (except prop up GDP numbers), or just simple cash handout like BR1M... the increased money supply + same demand for goods will just cause INFLATION.Malaysia GDP number is heavily propped up by government spending."
+3kk!,20170705,Look at all my stars!!,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 7,850",200605,,"well, thats cause most people look at personal numbersthe salary did increase over the years, and actually went up quite well in general. where it comes different is personal figures, because we are looking deep into details and are not looking at the big picture so the dynamics are different.take for example, HR is shit, work in HR? salary is stagnant hell. work 30 years and it would not go anywhere - sunset jobwhich comes to another thing a lot of folks dont talk about here, are their jobs sunset jobs? basically jobs that are dying (like taxi drivers) and are getting replaced by newer stuff. banking had one, they sacked entire back end departments cause new systems came in to play and when the atm was introduced, one teller was sacked for one atm. (you see it occasionally these days, local bank sacks 30 people - its coz systems)the other thing is KRA and performance, did the said individual hit the said KRA figures?the reality is, pay is a function of demand, we are selling our produce (labour) to our boss who combines it again to the end consumer. the customers demand for the services more, the pay goes up, likewise if you serve the customer well, your pay goes up.its the same even if we wanted to start a business, say i be a distributor and bring in 100 units with a yearly 100 MOQ, given that if i fail to hit 100, it would be near impossible to pay myself (incur a loss), if i hit 100 then i can pay the net profits and if i want to earn more, the next year i need to sell maybe 110 units.then theres diminishing returns.......I'm not saying we suck it up and live with it, thats not the story, what I'm saying is that most people are barking up the wrong tree. Pay is a function of our ability to generate wealth, not the government.hence why you see in the world, no matter how great the government or worse off the government is, you wont see a pay jump outside economic logic."

Heck, i would even add demand supply into the equation - more graduates every year, same if not lesser jobs therefore starting wages are barely moving. I would also buy it that the employers are largely to be blamed for this. But then, think again, what's the government roles amidst all these? Cost of living rising - while not solely - due to depreciating currency. Oversupply of graduates in some industry, the government could have policies in place to prevent this. Instead we have more and more not too qualified graduates flowing into the jobs market.Cast envious eyes to SG and u will see the pay is almost 1:1, the necessities are cheaper. Mobility wise while it's more expensive to own a car there, it's not really needed. Meanwhile we had to subsidize for Proton with audacious taxes for imported cars, with cars being almost a necessity with the shitty public transport system we have.Not saying that our government is the worst of all, but one would always be greedy and expect better, it's only human nature. I rest my case, regardless of whether u acknowledge the root of the problems is the incumbent government."

Its just shifting the goalpost really.which comes to SG, the average graduate earns about 1.8k sgd, the average NUS graduate earns 3k.  try surviving singapore with 1.8k, its pretty much the same, owh and the car thing? well that depends if you are willing to take an hour of train ride to work , back and have a life restricted to about 11pm. cause then its taxis. the only reason why you see SG with such envious eyes is cause you dont see their poor, people sleeping in void decks pissing in lifts and ""Rent"" apartments that are as large as your wingspan.well, i can understand greed , but i also understand reality. no one pays shit graduates and shit jobs high pay, you dont, I dont, no one does. Most people understand greed, but they cannot understand reality. they want better, feel entitled for it but put 0 effortwhich comes to the be all and end all question, when will msians wake up and realise to get somewhere least economically, they need to put in effort.one wonders really, if one day PH does indeed win, will msians stop blaming and sudd realise it was all in their hands?"
