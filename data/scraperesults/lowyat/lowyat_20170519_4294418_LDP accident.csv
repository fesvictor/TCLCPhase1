andrewhtf,20170519,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 780,200604,From: Clerking. Data Entry like a Mad Man,"Nope. in this case this is a chain of collision and the fault can be traced back all the way to the lorry. as long as the keputusan kes clearly describes this then the ultimate fault lies with the lorry. the rest of the car's NCD wont be affected since every insurer will eventually have claims against the lorry's insurance.your example of A & B accident and B lose NCD is valid only if there's only 2 party involved, A & B.When you have chain of collisions A B and C, and keputusan kes puts C as the party at fault, then B's NCD wont be lost as B's insurer puts the whole claims  (inclusive of A's amounts) from C's insurer. same goes to chain collision of ABCDEFG and so on and so forth, as long as eputusan kes names the party at fault, the party at fault punya insurer tanggung."
