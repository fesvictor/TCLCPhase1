So, I concluded that their action is political in nature,” he said.“It is believed that the DoJ action is based on information provided by a handful of Malaysians,” Apandi added.Fahmi said Apandi must have come to the conclusion based on detailed information his office had on 1MDB, including the police report and the auditor-general’s report on the sovereign wealth fund which has not been made public.“The attorney-general should therefore immediately publish the auditor-general’s report so that people at large can understand the 1MDB issue and the suit by the DoJ, and not harbour any doubt about the attorney-general’s statement,” he said.The DoJ’s court filing on June 15 sought to seize assets worth US$540 million (RM2.3 billion), including art works, a yacht, jewellery and film rights purchased with funds allegedly purchased with funds embezzled from 1MDB.Its first suit was filed in July last year when Washington sought to confiscate more than US$1 billion (RM4.28 billion) in connection with the sovereign wealth fund."
