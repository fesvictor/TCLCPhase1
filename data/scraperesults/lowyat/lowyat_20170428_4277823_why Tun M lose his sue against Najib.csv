silic0sis,20170428,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,200508,,Where does it say only a member of the public service can be found liable for misfeasance in public office? That doesn't make sense unless only members of public service can hold positions in public office which isn't true.

IMORTALfatahL2401,20170428,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 27,201305,,doesn't some opposition politicians also win several sues against for example utusan and yet when the law isn't on their side why does they/their supporters cry foul?
silic0sis,20170428,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,200508,,"I think it's quite clear right? He's suing for tort of misfeasance in public office, which in theory is a good thing if you want to get to the truth. If Najib is innocent, he can show his evidence."

silic0sis,20170428,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,200508,,"TBH I don't understand the counter argument, Najib's lawyer argues that Najib is not a member of the public service therefore he can't be sued for misfeasance in public office. But why does a person have to be a member of the public service to be sued for misfeasance in public office? I didn't read through the entire thing so I'm probably missing something."

silic0sis,20170428,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,200508,,But the lawsuit is for misfeasance in public office. Prime Minister holds position in public office.Edit: it says there that Najib's lawyer argued only members of public service can be sued for misfeasance in public office. Why is that the case? Why can't Prime Minister also be sued for misfeasance in public office?

Usage of each and every word has to be correct, precise and objective to the case filed.Such high level issue, can't imagine lawyer make some error at that level. Should change lawyer."

YellowKingValley,20170428,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 398,201412,,All as planned. Now you can't sue Mahathir for Bank Negara etc etc etc.Mahathir wins.Mahathir 1 Najib 1 Rakyat -2

Lawyers have the choice to choose to interpret the law as it is or twist to develop possibility (there are many open minded lawyers too). It's not about wrong or right."
