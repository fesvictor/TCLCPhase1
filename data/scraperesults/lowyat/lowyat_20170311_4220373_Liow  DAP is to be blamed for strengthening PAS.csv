Now that PAS is stronger, it is able to discard DAP,” Liow said.He pointed out that it was PAS which first severed ties with DAP on June 3, 2015 and that DAP only reciprocated 13 days later.“Even though they have severed ties, DAP is still working with PAS in Selangor,” he said, adding that these were verifiable facts.Later, Liow told reporters that MCA would continue to oppose the amendments even if these were to be passed."
