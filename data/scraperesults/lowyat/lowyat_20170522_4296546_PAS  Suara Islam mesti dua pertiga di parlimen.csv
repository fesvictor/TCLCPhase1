Majoriti penghuni negara ini ialah muslim. Pemimpin utama negara beragama Islam. Tapi umat Islam masih lemah dalam jumlah mereka yang ramai, hina di hadapan kaum bangsa sendiri, bangsat di atas tanahair sendiri.""Kuasa politik Islam wajib diperkasa. Suara Islam mestilah 2/3 majoriti di parlimen,"" jelas Nasrudin dalam satu kenyataan.Katanya lagi, umat Islam perlu bangkit dari lena yang panjang dan keluar dari zon selesa mereka.""Umat Islam wajib bersatu untuk mengembalikan maruah dan izzah ummah,"" kata Nasrudin.Pada masa ini, terdapat  seramai 135 anggota parlimen beragama Islam di Dewan Rakyat atau bersaaman 61 peratus daripada keseluruhan 222 anggota parlimen.Gesaan Nasrudin itu adalah jauh berbeza dengan slogan ""PAS untuk semua"" pada dua pilihan raya umum yang lalu.PAS baru-baru ini memutuskan hubungan dengan PKR dan merancang untuk bertanding sekurang-kurangnya 100 kerusi parlimen di seluruh negara."

They forgot the majority Buddhist Chinese specialists saving them from chronic illnesses caused by their own bad habits? The traders running our economy? Despite doing a lot for this country, we should just band together to make sure they dont have a say in this country's direction? Penunggang agama. Gunakan agama untuk raih kuasa politik semata mata."

bigwolf,20170522,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 227,201108,,"Times like these, we non-muslims should be careful in how we respond, spit at the talibans, not generalization at all malays/muslims. Remember, not all malays/muslims share the talibans ideology. Remember, this is also another form of bait. Bait non-muslims to lash out, and they will point at generalizations like ""orang kite"" ""religion of peace"" ""biasalah ini islam"" etc, to instigate all muslims"
