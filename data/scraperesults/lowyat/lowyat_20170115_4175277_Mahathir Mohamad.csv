LamTin,20170115,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201010,,"7ZZqNRn3ia4SHAH ALAM: Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) has indicated that it will maintain the 1Malaysia People’s Aid (BR1M) if it wins in the next general election.Its chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said BR1M would be maintained if it was found to be essential, but would have to be made into a statutory aid determined by law and the budget.Dr Mahathir also announced that the party would contest in the next general election as a component party of the opposition coalition.» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «“The opposition coalition’s past bids failed as they were not united,” he said.He added that the opposition coalition would now use a single symbol, manifesto and place only one candidate in each area.“Those other parties that claim they want to contest against Barisan Nasional need not contest, as they would likely only split the rakyat’s support,” said Dr Mahathir at PPBM’s official launch at Stadium Melawati here yesterday.He said the coalition was still willing to take on three-cornered fights if it came to that.Dr Mahathir said PPBM would represent Malay and Bumiputra interest.Among the election promises put forward were to replace the Goods and Services Tax with a sales tax, to stem the sale of land to foreigners and to keep Malaysia insulated from ties with the world political blocs.PPBM president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and deputy president Datuk Seri Mukhriz Mahathir also delivered speeches at the event.Among the opposition members present at the launch included PKR president Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, Parti Amanah Negara president Mohamad Sabu, Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Azmin Ali and DAP politician Teresa Kok.Experience and successful veteran is really something different. Mahathir is the only politician at age over 90 on earth that still concern on rakyat's welfare. May Allah be with us and land Opposition party into victory in the next 14th General Election to mark new history of Malaysia and in the meantime to teach Barisan Nasional a lesson !"

cedyy,20170115,Regular,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,081",200906,,i dont think they'll step aside. DAP has always contested in higher Chinese voters constituencies. It's either PAS or PKR that'll have to give way
LamTin,20170115,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201010,,DAP winning margin at their current constituencies was freaking high last GE. Same winning seats will be contested by DAP to ensure victory. Only those PKR and PAS seats last GE are the main problem. PKR and PPBM have to sort things out as PAS will move in to have 3 corners fight together with Barisan. Only if Nik Aziz is alive then PAS wont betray opposition. Now under Hadi Awang will only spoil the situation in Selangor and Perak
