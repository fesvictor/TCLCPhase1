But those who place importance on values are against it,” said a DAP leader.Harapan’s core values at stakeOne PKR leader explained that putting Bersatu at the helm would unravel Harapan’s core values, which emphasises on consensus.“Harapan is about equality – all parties are the same, have an equal voice, a principle of consensus and so on.“So far nothing is evident that there is a huge Malay swing that is called Malay tsunami due to Bersatu,” he said.Those who opposed the idea believe that Malaysians are more concerned about bread and butter issues compared to racial sentiments.“I think we should spend more time explaining how we can make common people’s lives better through our policy offerings, and less time thinking about a strategy of co-habitation, hoping for a tsunami to come,” said another insider.Regardless of sentiment, betting on Bersatu to win over the Malays, especially those in Umno’s rural vote banks, could be a worthwhile gamble.The opposition has already made significant gains among urban Malaysians, as well as the non-Malays, meaning that their potential to convert more supporters among this voter demographic is plateauing.This can be seen in the results of the past two general elections.With their efforts focused on urban and semi-rural voters, the opposition made significant gains in 2008, pushing up its popular vote share by almost 14 percent, compared with 2004.The opposition largely maintained this strategy in 2013, but preaching to the converted meant the payoff was far smaller. Its popular vote share rose only three percent, compared with 2008.If the opposition wants to win over more supporters, then it must focus on new grounds, such as the Malay-dominated Felda settlements"

clydefrog,20170611,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 22,201302,,Nothing to do with seats. DAP is seen as a Chinese party and the majority of Malays will never accept a Chinese party ruling malaysia therefore they need bersatu or another Malay based party to front PH whether it's 1 seat or 100 seats. If DAP demand the PM seat you can be 100% sure that PH will be wiped out in the next election apart from those few Chinese seats that they will win. The real losers in all this are the rakyat. Oppositions calls BN a kleptocracy but opposition itself is a complete mess that can't even name its shadow cabinet. Who is going to vote for a coalition that cannot even agree on the prime minister?
