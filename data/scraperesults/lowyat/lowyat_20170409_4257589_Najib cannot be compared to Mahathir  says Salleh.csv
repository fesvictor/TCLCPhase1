big[1],20170409,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 588,201506,,"KUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Najib Razak cannot be compared to Dr Mahathir Mohamad as the latter carries a lot of baggage with him, says Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Said Keruak.In the latest entry in his blog sskeruak.blogspot.my, Salleh wrote, “Mahathir carries with him a lot of baggage. He was Prime Minister during the time a number of regimes surrounding Malaysia were ousted.“And Mahathir was compared as apple-to-apples with these ousted dictators. So comparing Najib to Mahathir would be negative for Najib.”Salled also said western media had accused Mahathir of wasting billions of ringgit of the nation’s money including billions more in what they labelled as “leakages”.“This was published in a book and is another Mahathir legacy which Najib should not be compared with,” Salleh said.The minister said that in 2013, Mahathir accused Najib of neglecting the Malays and of pandering to the Chinese, whereas it was the Malays who supported Umno.“For sure Najib cannot be compared to Dr Mahathir,” Salleh said.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...ir-says-salleh/"
