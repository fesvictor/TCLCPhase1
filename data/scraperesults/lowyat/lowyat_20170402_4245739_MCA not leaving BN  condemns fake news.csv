Coup De Grace,20170402,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,201611,,"PETALING JAYA: MCA has condemned a fake news article announcing the party’s withdrawal from the ruling coalition and has categorically denied that it is leaving the Barisan Nasional.A fake article announcing the party’s withdrawal from the ruling coalition began circulating on social media on Saturday, which is April Fool’s day.“This is a lie with bad intentions. The creator of this slander is playing a trick to create chaos,” said MCA deputy president Wee Ka Siong in a report quoted in The Star.The fake article was written in the form of a news article and quoted Liow as well as Tourism and Culture Minister Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz, among others.“MCA president Liow Tiong Lai is currently in India as part of the Malaysian delegation with Prime Minister Najib Razak,” Wee said, adding that the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission must investigate the spread of the slanderous news on social media.The fake news article claimed that this was the “biggest political development in Malaysia”, saying Liow had disclosed the news to reporters after a “quarterly MCA Central Committee meeting”.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...emns-fake-news/"

ray123,20170403,Senior Citizen,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 2,450",200301,,"It's funnier that MCA thinks they are still relevant politically. Fact is, most people think of MCA as being more of a NGO. They really do some good in some aspects (eg 1MCA Medical Foundation), but they are hopeless politically.Even with DAP Melaka in disarray recently, nobody gives a damn about MCA."
