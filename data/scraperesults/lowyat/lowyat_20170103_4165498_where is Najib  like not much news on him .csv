everest,20170103,Getting Started,Group: Super Senior,Posts: 61,200709,,"The Malaysian government’s Airbus Corporate Jet A319 has been zipping across Australia, which coincided with Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak’s family holiday Down Under.The aircraft, bearing the registration number 9M-NAA, took off from Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah airport in Subang Jaya on Dec 22 at 12.07am and landed in Gold Coast, Australia at 10.06am the same day.?However, the stop was brief as the aircraft took off from Gold Coast at 11.47am and landed in Brisbane at 12.09pm. The plane stayed in Brisbane for four days.There are no direct commercial flights between Brisbane and Gold Coast as they are only 110km apart, or an hour's drive. 9M-NAA, a non-commercial jet, made the journey by air in around 20 minutes."
