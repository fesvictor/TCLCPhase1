I will take action against them without fear or favour,"" he reiterated.Dzulkifli, however, added that the MACC does have its own limitations.""There are only 2,900 members and officers in the whole of the MACC, of which only 900 carry out legal enforcement as others are in the prevention and education departments, among others.""Now if you look at civil service alone, there are 1.6mil of them, so that is one.""Besides that is budget, that has been cut and it is at its lowest since 2013,"" he said.Dzulkifli, however, added that he would not allow the limitations to stop the anti-graft body from carrying out its duties.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...U4tkhDTrQTA6.99"
