The decision of the court was obviously influenced by the government and I think the incoming government would be able to persuade the king to give a full pardon for Anwar,"" Mahathir told the Guardian.""In which case he would be able to participate in politics and become PM. I can have no objection to that.""Malaysia's political landscape has been shaped for nearly two decades by a bitter feud between Anwar and Mahathir.Anwar was once a protege of the veteran prime minister, Mahathir, and the rising star of Malaysian politics, but they fell out in the late 1990s.Soon afterwards, Anwar was jailed for the first time on charges of sodomy and graft, after being sacked as the deputy prime minister. He denied the charges, dismissing them as politically motivated.He was convicted and jailed in 2013, when Najib was prime minister, for another sodomy charge, which he and his supporters described as a politically motivated attempt to end his career.But after their years of animosity, opposition to Prime Minister Najib is drawing Anwar and Mahathir back together.Last year, Anwar endorsed a political compact spearheaded by Mahathir to fight Najib.Najib has been embroiled in a corruption scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad. He has denied any wrongdoing, even as the fund became the subject of money laundering investigations in the United States and at least five other countries.The sodomy conviction disqualifies Anwar from political office and from contesting the next election that must be held by mid-2018. A royal pardon, however, would let him contest.Government sources have told Reuters that Najib had been preparing to call polls in September, but the timing has since become less clear in the wake of the scandals.Last month, Anwar said he would not be a candidate for prime minister in the upcoming elections.Mahathir, who turns 92 next week, has said he would consider taking up the premier position again, but only if there was no acceptable candidate after an opposition election victory."

Saya tidak ada bantahan,” demikian kata Pengerusi Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad dalam temubual bersama akhbar The Guardian hari ini.Beliau malah mengulangi desakannya supaya Anwar dibebaskan dan dibenarkan kembali terlibat dalam politik.“Dalam kes Anwar kita boleh berhujah yang dia tidak dilayan secara adil,” tambah beliau yang memecat Anwar pada tahun 1998.Tun Mahathir juga mengakui bahawa tribulasi yang berlaku terhadap bekas timbalannya itu pada waktu ini merupakan mangsa dendam politik.Dalam perkara berkaitan, peguam Anwar kini sedang berusaha untuk membebaskannya daripada penjara selepas wujud bukti terbaru muncul mengaitkan pendakwaraya kerajaan dibayar RM9.5 juta daripada akaun bank peribadi milik Perdana Menteri Najib Razak.Tan Sri Shafee Abdullah, yang digaji kerajaan untuk mengetuai pasukan pendakwaan dalam kes tersebut memberitahu wartawan yang beliau akan memberikan maklum balas tentang perkara itu pada 9 Jun lalu tetapi sehingga kini masih belum berbuat demikian.Sementara itu, Mahkamah Tinggi Kuala Lumpur juga mengarahkan kerajaan dan Shafee untuk memberikan balasan jawapan kepada permohonan Anwar untuk mengetepikan sabitan jenayahnya.Ini susulan pendedahan Sarawak Report pada 31 Mei yang mendakwa bahawa Shafee dibayar sejumlah wang daripada akaun bank yang dikawal perdana menteri."
