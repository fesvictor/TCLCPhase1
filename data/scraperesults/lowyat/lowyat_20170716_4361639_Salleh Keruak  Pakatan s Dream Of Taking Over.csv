The Communications and Multimedia Minister said the success of DAP and PKR in the 2008 and 2013 general elections was because of PAS' support when it joined Pakatan Rakyat (now defunct and replaced by Pakatan Harapan).  “Without the support of PAS voters, the DAP and PKR will definitely not win. Without PAS' support, DAP and PKR are no longer strong,"" said Salleh.  ""Without PAS, with 70% of PAS voters no longer voting for the opposition pact, the Opposition will be crippled,” he added in his blog sskeruak.blogspot.my on Sunday.  Salleh said PKR and Amanah cannot help the Opposition draw Malay voters as both parties do not have a strong political base and their pact remains flimsy. “With this, the new Pakatan Harapan will definitely not get the confidence of the voters,” he said.  Salleh added that DAP only won in the 2008 GE when it joined forces with PAS, gaining 28 seats and PKR, 31, while its collaboration with PAS in the GE13 saw it getting 38 seats and PKR (30).  “When DAP stood alone, the party's achievements were not encouraging. In the 1969 GE, when the Opposition won big, DAP only garnered 13 seats, 1974 (9), 1978 (16), 1982 (9), 1986 (24), 1990 (20) and 1995 (9),” Salleh said.  He added that in GE13, 84.84% of the total 13,268,002 registered voters cast their votes, with Barisan Nasional (BN) gaining 5,237,699 votes, PAS (1,633,389), DAP (1,736,267), and the rest to other parties. “History has shown that PAS is core to the Opposition's strength just like Umno is to BN. Today's reality is that DAP is the core to Pakatan Harapan,” he said.  - Bernamahttp://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...yh8GJTK0hSp9.99"
