It is “highly inappropriate” to say that the four DAP leaders from Malacca quit the party because they lost in the party elections, said Datuk Teng Chang Khim.The Selangor DAP vice-chairman said that the party election was sometime ago and that some of the four had been suspended for a year before quitting.“It is not a sincere to say ‘thank you’ by claiming that they have left the party after losing in the election,” said Teng, who is also Sg Pinang state assemblyman.He was responding to a statement by DAP central executive committee member Liew Chin Tong who said the four DAP leaders from Malacca quit the party because they lost in the party elections that was held in December, 2015.On Sunday, Kota Melaka MP Sim Tong Him and three state assemblymen dropped a bombshell by quitting the party.Sim said the four quit because the DAP now has no proper direction and that it has deviated from its core objectives.The other three who quit are former Malacca DAP chairman Goh Leong San (DAP-Duyong), Lim Jak Wong (DAP-Bachang) and Chin Choon Seong (DAP-Kesidang).“Liew has also forgotten that most of them are far more senior than him in the party struggle,” said Teng.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...ohxEJvVgrfBm.99"

2malaysia,20170217,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 138,201205,,"DAP core values are to eliminate all racial and religion discrimination in Malaysia and provide a platform forpeople of all races and religion to compete fairly as its citizen. Meaning DAP would like to renounce Mara Act 1976 who create the Ministry of Higher Education who channel billions to Mara to create a Malay only Mega-university in the expense of all other university like UM, USM UPM etc..and to renounce Petroleum Development Act 1974 who put all Umno people to manage and give billions of Petroluemproject to their own cronies and Umnoputraetc etc..Of course political party has supporter to voice out their reasons for supporting Umno but whether is it voluntary or paid works are a concern. Rafizi has the following findings in government department JASA that out of 400+ department employee in Jasa 140+ are contract workers who are likely Cybertrooper. Is Ironmaid89 a paid JASA contract worker ? Maybe..hETd0vFWlc4Using Rakyat Tax money to promote Umno is completely wrong but  Umno are Kleptocrates...Correct But..Mother of All Fact = DAP only compete in 30+ parliamentary seats so even if they won all seats DAP cannotform the government by itself because total parliament seats are 222. So DAP is only choosing the less evilof the two, Umno or Bersatu. For those who resigned from DAP, they are just too old in the thinking to acceptthe reality. Umno is a big organisation like need many steps to cripple it and to bring it down, so these  Sim Tong Him, Goh Leong San, Lim Jack Wong and Chin Choong Seong think the god will make Umno vanish and DAPthen become the government ? So Naive..But of course anyone can be outside of DAP and still able to support DAP like superman CKY andothers."

DAP komited untuk menjunjung Perlembagaan Persekutuan Malaysia sebagai undang-undang yang paling agung negara dan meluhurkannya dalam semangat Merdeka 1957 dan Perjanjian Malaysia 1963Memelihara kedudukan istimewa orang Melayu dan Bumiputra serta hak-hak kaum-kaum lain, seperti yang termaktub dalam Artikel 153 Perlembagaan Persekutuan.Memastikan kedudukan Islam sebagai agama Persekutuan serta kebebasan untuk mengamalkan agama-agama lain dengan aman dan damai, seperti yang termaktub dalam Artikel 3 dan 11 Perlembagaan Persekutuan.Memartabatkan Bahasa Melayu sebagai Bahasa Kebangsaan seperti yang termaktub dalam Artikel 152 Perlembagaan Persekutuan, serta menggalakkan penggunaan dan pengajian bahasa-bahasa ibunda lain untuk membentukkan masyarakat yang cemerlang dan berbilang bahasa.https://dapmalaysia.org/lembaran-baru-untuk-rakyat-malaysia/DAP made that pledge in 2012. Again it was sign and inserted into PPBM-PH alliance agreement.If DAP tries to pull back /renegade on their promise, Malay will turn on them, including me...."
