GnomeMage,20170719,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 41,201206,,strange cause despite all the negatives and scandals I think the MRT infrastructure might be najib's stroke of brilliance. better and more public transport is one of the things we need here desperately due to high auto price. Najib hit the sweet spot right there by providing us what we need.I have more favourable view of najib now after the MRT project open.

If opposition cannot even get their backbones straight, how do you expect them to govern the nation? Every day just lip service and bad mouthing, if they focus on actionable results and keep doing that, people will notice and it may well sway things to their favor. But this is not the case. You see, BN is very smart, they just need to do something, keep on marketing it and making the opposition looks useless, they win.

Every gomen have its good and bad part, you cant said bijan team is good gomen just because of 1 single MRT project, like they screw up on 1MDB."

Bijan has extremely intelligent people in his PEMANDU and ETP team which is the core component of Malaysia's economic reformation.Pakatan Harapan has extremely less intelligent people like Rafizi Ramli and Mat Sabu. Rafizi Ramli doesn't even understand the lies that he spreads."

yhcyber,20170719,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 199,200605,From: Seremban/KL,"Every single team build up with different kind of people, depend on what the leader wants. No body can deny that there is intelligent people in Bijan team and Pakatan Team, the difference is, how those people presented themselves in the team. The most obvious is, Bijan team doesn't accept different opinion nor voice in the team, but pakatan yes, and that's the main reason you see Pakatan as a mess.Our economy doesn't change entirely by a single man or unit, it is a constant hardwork by rakyat, what gomen did is to amplify our nation advantage and boost the economy, so the credit not entirely goes to gomen. If BN can do it, why not Pakatan? Yes, I don't like how messy Pakatan is, but at least Selangor and Penang is developing well compare to 10 years ago which was under BN rule. At the same time, I still seeing there is a lot of GE promise doesn't happen as what Pakatan made, same situation goes to BN.As a rakyat, I am weighting both parties performance. My current living environment, cost, crime, safety, will be my best benchmarks to let me know who should win my vote   Cheers!"
