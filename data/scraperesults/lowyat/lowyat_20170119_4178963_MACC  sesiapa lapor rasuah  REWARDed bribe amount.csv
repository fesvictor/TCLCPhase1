bg12,20170119,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 154,201607,,"MACC: Civil servants reporting corruption will get reward matching bribeBY D.KANYAKUMARIhttp://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...matching-bribe/ PETALING JAYA: Civil servants who report instances of corruption will receive an incentive equal to the amount offered in the bribe, says Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission (MACC) deputy chief commissioner Datuk Shamsun Bahrin Mohd Jamil (pic).""For example, an officer was offered a bribe of RM10,000 and he reports it to us – if the case goes through and the accused is charged, the officer would be granted a RM10,000 incentive which matches the bribe,"" he said.Shamsun Bahrin added that the lowest incentive offered would be RM500.""If it (the offered bribe) is RM1,000 then the incentive would match that,"" he said.Shamsun Bahrin added in an interview on Thursday that the incentives were introduced by the former Chief Secretary to the Government, without specifying who it was.He added that this was to encourage civil servants to report bribery, which would in turn eradicate corruption altogether.However, said that only 162 civil servants had reported instances bribery despite the incentive.""There are 1.6 million civil servants, so only 0.01% of them have reported cases. We do not want this,"" he added, urging more civil servants to step up against corruption.We do not want the public sector to be seen as corrupt. Sadly not many civil servants are willing to step up, although we have the Witness Protection Act and Whistleblower Protection Act,"" he said."
