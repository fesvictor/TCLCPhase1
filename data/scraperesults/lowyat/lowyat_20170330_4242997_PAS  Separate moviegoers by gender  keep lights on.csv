Nothing about academics, econs, international stuff, nope. Even if got just 5%. There is nothing positive about pas. All negativity and impose rule by 'fear' = kau tak sokong pas, kau munafik/kafir.

In the Borneon states, we have a frigging cabbotage policy, yet  that didn't stop us.  Maybe if Kelantan was serious from the start at developing its ECONOMY, the federal government will start taking it seriously but lol what have they done for the last 60 years apart from producing tahfiz grads?  Whadda heck man, Kelantan is so much closer to highly urbanised parts of Malaysia compared to Sabah and Sarawak and they still cant pull it off ? even after 60 years?"
