When completed, the ECRL would become a major land bridge for trade in and out of Asia.’, Yeo said, questioning the omission of the route between Port Klang and Gombak, if the link to the west coast port was indeed very important.She also questioned if there was an agenda by Putrajaya in leaving the Pakatan Harapan-led Selangor government from the decision-making process.“Are they going push down our throat whatever their plan is at a later date? Is the federal government trying to hide something about the project?”With the ECRL costing a reported RM55 billion, Yeo said it was possible that around 1,000 pieces of land would need to be acquired once the alignment in Selangor is finalised.“It will give a lot of economical and social impact to the people of Selangor. Hence, the state government and Selangorians deserve to be better informed about the project,” she said."
