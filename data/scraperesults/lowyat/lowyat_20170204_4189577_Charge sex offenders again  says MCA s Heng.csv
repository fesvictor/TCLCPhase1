The 56 year-old, dubbed “Canada’s worst rapist”, will return to Malaysia from Canada this weekend after spending 24 years in jail there.Ramkarpal said there was no doubt that sexual offences are possibly “the most heinous of crimes” which should be severely punished but Heng’s suggestion can’t be entertained as it went against Article 7 (2) of the Federal Constitution.Article 7 (2) of the Federal Constitution states that “a person acquitted or convicted of an offence shall not be tried again for the same offence except where the conviction or acquittal has been quashed and a retrial ordered by a court superior to that by which he was acquitted or convicted”.This rule – known as double jeopardy – was a constitutional guarantee that no one could be tried for the same offence twice.Ramkarpal said abolishing the double jeopardy rule required a constitutional amendment.“Heng and the MCA should concentrate on efforts to avoid the recurrence of sexual offences such as, perhaps, the introduction of a national registry of sex offenders or placing tracking devices on repeat offenders to ascertain their whereabouts.“There can be no doubt that all parties, regardless of political affiliation, would be united in such a cause but demanding the abolishment of the rule against double jeopardy is certainly a step in the wrong direction.”Selva Kumar returns to Malaysia as a free man this weekend but the police have said they would monitor him."

That is a constitutional right of any person in this country.”Ramkarpal however agreed with calls to introduce a sex offenders’ registry in Malaysia to monitor those convicted of sex crimes.Heng had earlier suggested that the principle of double jeopardy, which disallows a person from being tried for the same offence twice, should not apply to sex offenders.Ramkarpal said there was no need for a new conviction in order for a person to be included in a sex offenders’ registry.“I am unable to see the need to obtain a new conviction here for the same offence committed overseas in order for the said offender to be registered on the said sex offenders’ register here,” he said.Selva Kumar, 56, arrived in Malaysia today, more than three decades after he left the country for Canada.In 1992, a Canadian court found him guilty of sexual assault, drug abuse, extortion and various other charges, and sentenced him to 24 years’ imprisonment."
