The first thing the BN Strategic Communications Team attacked me was ""Petrol does not magically transfer from the refinery into your car's petrol tank.""If that isn't a clever misdirection, I don't know what is.Transport and other costs were unchanged between December and January, and hence had no bearings to the 20 sen increase in petrol price. So why should I take into consideration transport costs in trying to make sense of the 20 sen increase in petrol price?At least this time, they provided further details on the petrol price calculations. The key difference between our calculations was that I used the month-end closing exchange rate and they used daily closing.But EVEN if you take their response at face value (remember, somehow the Minister/Ministry isn't responding), the difference between December and January is a 7.21 sen increase based on their own calculations.So where did the 20 sen increase come from? Where does the difference go to?Is this the reason why there was ""misdirection"" at the beginning of their statement, so that you miss the point? And is that the reason why the Government is so reluctant to publish monthly details of how petrol prices are calculated?And oh, so I should apologise for asking clarifications from the Government?"
