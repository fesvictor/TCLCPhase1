I never contradicted the prime minister. Don't try to split me and the prime minister with this matter,"" he told Malaysiakini.""I have no problems with the prime minister, we have a good working relationship,"" he said, adding that Najib understood his position and did not seek clarification over the disclosure of the letter's existence.Johari also denied objecting to the settlement, claiming his statements in supporting the move had been consistent.The minister said his disclosure to Malaysiakini regarding the letter was merely a follow-up to his statement regarding the matter in the Dewan Rakyat last November.Johari also responded to PKR vice-president Rafizi Ramli and BN lawmaker Marcus Mojigoh's call for him to make the letter public.""Who is Rafizi to ask me to publish (the letter)?"" he questioned, adding he could not do that as it was a confidential and caveat letter.""If Rafizi thinks what I said in November 2016 in Parliament is wrong, he can always refer my conduct to the parliamentary privileges committee,"" he added.However, he said Marcus and other members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) could have access to the letter if the PAC writes to the ministry to seek permission.Johari also brushed off Pua's allegation that Najib was conflicted in making the decision with regard to the settlement.""You can assume anything, but in the end of the day, in the court of law, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. So, you cannot simply make a conclusion when no one has been found guilty,"" he added."
