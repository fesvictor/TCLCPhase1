Najib is the one who put him (in jail),” Dr Mahathir said as he was leaving.The Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia chairman, however, refused to endorse Anwar as the Opposition’s choice as prime minister.When all the top leadership held up placards saying “Anwar PM Ke-7” (Anwar as 7th PM) at the opening of the congress, Dr Mahathir instead took out his smart phone to take pictures of the crowd.- See more at: http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...h.ADFbRK20.dpuf"
