MRaef,20170410,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 98,200511,,Expected scenario - PAS will win/retain their rights to form a state govt but will lose their majority in votes.Worst case scenario - PAS lose some of its seats and might have to create a coalition govt with whoever win most seats below them.

Dun want the possibility of handing more MP seats to BN.But yeah...give PAS a taste of their own medicine in Kelantan. Nevermind the result, just make it a 3-cornered fight since PAS wants to kacau elsewhere."
