PappyBoyington,20170326,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"MARCH 26 — On DAP, I must confess that I have mixed feelings toward the party.I was its supporter when DAP was weak. When the party was suppressed, I was its sympathizer. When it was growing, I watched it with full of expectation. When it is already strong, I hope I am one of them who monitors the party.The process, right from the 80s till now, spans across more than 30 years. It is also a reflection of DAP’s political process. The party has developed from an opposition party struggling to survive to a party with overwhelming support from the majority of Chinese in Malaysia. It is also the No 1 opposition party in parliament and the ruling party for two states.Political power comes along with the rise of the party, so does economic resources. In any democratic society, power and resources are subjected to monitoring. This is the most precious part of democracy.Accepting monitoring and criticism are the qualities that DAP should possess. Ultimately the party owns power and resources due to democracy.Few days ago, DAP Secretary-General cum Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng issued Sin Chew Daily a legal notice seeking apology and compensation from the paper based on a news report on Penang Gerakan chairman Teng Chang Yeow’s statement.This is perhaps the most “ridiculous” legal notice received by the paper so far.The news report does not carry any opinion of reporter nor commentary piece. It is merely quoting Teng’s comments and the content of the report is on public policy without targeting at any individual.This is the most normal kind of news report which is also the style of news article written by a reporter each day after covering an assignment.If such news report is not allowed, then there would not be any newspapers in the world.Going by the norm, if the person involved does not agree with the news report, he can clarify and express his views. Sin Chew Daily would be providing such opportunity and space for the clarification.The politics of DAP still remain at its “primitive” phase.“Primitive” means basic, using low technology, low knowledge level to run a production. The outcome is wastage, lack of efficiency and low in productivity.Malaysians have advanced in terms of political awareness in 21st century today. People look forward to modern competition among political parties. Politicians are to be equipped with the concept of rule of law. They are to be humane in thinking and rational in their policy.Using violent and vulgar words to insult and tick off others do not match with the standard of civilization and thus losing scores in democracy.Such behavior results in more confrontations in the society. The Malay society would relate DAP more to racial extremism without requiring any effort from Umno or Utusan Malaysia.As the No 1 opposition party with more than 80% of support from Chinese voters, DAP does not show its prowess nor delivery on national issues affecting the future of Chinese.Besides pushing the responsibility to MCA, challenging MCA ministers to resign on the amendment bill of Act 355 (Syariah Court (criminal jurisdiction) 1965 Act), does the party have any better solution?DAP does not explain the outcome of its collaboration with PAS, nor offer any apology.The number of DAP MPs in the parliament is five time of the MCA. This means that DAP receives more mandate from non-Muslims. It should be shouldering responsibilities and not blaming others. Why does it rely on MCA?If MCA ministers were to resign, then do the 36 DAP MPs (except for Sim Tong Him who has left DAP) resign too?A stronger DAP with more power and resources now, does this mean it should be shouldering more responsibilities?People love DAP, doesn’t DAP reward people in return?The Malay mainstream society rejects DAP, people sandwiched in between cut ties with DAP, these are not without valid reasons. It will remain till a day when the party can communicate with the mainstream society and people, showing its capability in handling complex issues in multi-racial society.Without targeting at DAP, I list down some views here and sincerely hope the party can reflect and do not let us down. Live up to the expectation of people and the country.- Tay Tian Yanhttp://www.themalaymailonline.com/what-you...de-tay-tian-yan"

A seasoned newspaper editor who is also a long-time DAP supporter tells DAP not to be so langsi and respect the rule of law, if they ever expect to win more votes.Also told DAP not to be extreme racists.

FatalExe,20170326,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 229,200801,,"I wonder when will we get editorials criticizing the federal government or the ministers. And this is funny. Mainstream Journalism that claims to be impartial at its finest... and they wonder why ""80% of the people support DAP over MCA"". This editorial reflects the quality of the newspaper, sadly.As the No 1 opposition party with more than 80% of support from Chinese voters, DAP does not show its prowess nor delivery on national issues affecting the future of Chinese. DAP never claimed to be a Chinese party though... is he really a ""hardcore"" DAP supporter? and isn't fighting for equal rights positively affects future of non-Malays?Besides pushing the responsibility to MCA, challenging MCA ministers to resign on the amendment bill of Act 355 (Syariah Court (criminal jurisdiction) 1965 Act), does the party have any better solution?Well no shit MCA ministers have the responsibility to resign for talking big about how BN reached consensus that they will all be against Act 355.... now UMNO decided to table it instead! Without targeting at DAP, I list down some views here and sincerely hope the party can reflect and do not let us down. Live up to the expectation of people and the country.its like starting a racist statement by saying ""I'm not a racist, but ....."" an article that is talking about DAP ends with the editor claiming the article doesn't target DAP. Talk about journalism standards... it reflects why mainstream media is having worse perception as time goes byThe number of DAP MPs in the parliament is five time of the MCA. This means that DAP receives more mandate from non-Muslims. It should be shouldering responsibilities and not blaming others. Why does it rely on MCA?Because MCA is the one with FEDERAL MINISTERS and they are a COMPONENT PARTY of the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, BARISAN NATIONAL? also, unless he has demographic breakdown of the votes, ""receiving more mandate from non-Muslims"" is just speculation and baseless, made-up statistic. Is he really a journalist?"

FatalExe,20170326,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 229,200801,,"Did I say that? did you even read my comment? I am commenting on the hypocrisy of this so-called ""DAP supporter"" editor. The only valid argument he made in his statement is about the frivolous lawsuit. In fact the whole article afterwards is propaganda that doesn't make sense. Its not good to claim journalism ethics and freedom while spouting propaganda. It reflects badly on his ""journalism freedom and ethics"". Don't be a blind cybertrooper and learn to use your eyes and brains ok?"
