The difference is when I came back, I worked in a public hospital, I set up a heart centre for the people.“Unlike the other party (DAP), (where) they always criticise (others) and their doctors work in private, making money for themselves and yet serving the public (as lawmakers).”Dr Sim also expressed regret that he was not given the opportunity to speak during the debate.“It’s very unfair to me that I did not have a chance to stand up a few times (in the assembly) to say something.“My learned colleagues are practising lawyers and (they) keep arguing about facts, yet they are practising double standards.”However, DAP has hit back at the accusations, with Chong’s special assistant, Abdul Aziz Isa, calling the motion a “blatant disregard” of the voters’ choice and disrespect of the democratic processes.DAP’s Bukit Assek assemblywoman Irene Chang added that today’s proceedings set a dangerous precedent for the state.“We see a crossover of the functions of judiciary, executive and legislative. This is the basic principle of a democratic country, the separations of powers,” she told FMT.“What happened today was a travesty of this democratic principle. The checks and balance purpose of the intention of having three branches of the government is now at risk. To me, today is a sad day.”http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...-me-to-dap-rep/"
