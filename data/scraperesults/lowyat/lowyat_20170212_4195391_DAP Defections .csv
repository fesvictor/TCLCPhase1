Cuba ikuti perkembangan.Edit: Updated as per advice from MSGaijinhttp://www.malaysiakini.com/news/372170Four Malacca DAP elected representatives have resigned from the party, according to Oriental Daily Online today.The four, Kota Melaka MP Sim Tong Him, Duyong assemblyperson Goh Leong San, Bachang assemblyperson Lim Jak Wong and Kesidang assemblyperson Chin Choong Seong, were reported announcing their decision at a press conference today.A video clip of the press conference accompanied the Oriental Daily report.The quartet said their resignation will take effect immediately, and cited disappointment with party leaders and claims that DAP has strayed from its original goals, as the reasons.Sim also apologised for supporting PAS, the former Pakatan Rakyat partner, in the 13th GE claiming it had accelerated Malaysia's Islamisation.Last February, Sim and Goh were suspended for a year, for repeatedly making statements that allegedly damaged the party's reputation.The resignations have left DAP with three remaining state seats, Kota Laksamana, Bandar Hilir and Ayer Keroh, and no MPs."

PappyBoyington,20170212,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/372201DAP acting chairperson Tan Kok Wai has welcomed the resignation of four of the party’s elected representatives in Malacca.He said contrary to the quartet’s claim that DAP had strayed from its original goals, it was the four representatives who had changed.“I welcome their resignation because they have changed and I consider them a cancer within the party. Since they are leaving on their own initiative, I welcome it,” he told reporters in Pudu today.He was asked to respond to the resignations of Kota Melaka MP Sim Tong Him, Duyong assemblyperson Goh Leong San, Bachang assemblyperson Lim Jak Wong and Kesidang assemblyperson Chin Choong Seong earlier today.The resignations came just as Sim and Goh’s one-year suspensions from the party came to an end last week.Tan, who is also the DAP disciplinary committee chairperson, said the four had spoken and acted in ways that are harmful to the party."
