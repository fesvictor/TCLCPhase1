Only after that will I make any announcement,” Baru was quoted as saying by the Kuching-based daily.Adenan retained Tanjung Datu by a majority of 5,892 votes in the state election held last May. He secured 6,360 votes against 468 votes picked up by PKR candidate Jazolkipli Numan, who even lost his deposit.Meanwhile, Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) Youth secretary Bit Surang hopes there would be no contest in Tanjung Datu.“If Sarawakians really mourn the passing of Adenan, let them walk the talk. They should let the Barisan Nasional (BN) candidate for Tanjung Datu win unopposed,” Bit said, according to BP.Sarawak PAS chief Jofri Jaraiee, who expects GE14 to be held soon, said his party prefers to focus on the parliamentary election.“We will most likely not contest there (Tanjung Datu) as a sign of respect for Adenan,” Jofri was quoted as saying, adding that it was because the former chief minister always had the people’s interest at heart.Last week, sources in Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) were quoted as saying in a national daily that the party has shortlisted five potential candidates.The sources declined to disclose the five names but said that two of the possible candidates were close to Adenan.The Sarawak Assembly is expected to announce Tanjung Datu as a vacant seat after the seven-day mourning period ends this Wednesday. Last Wednesday, Adenan passed away following a heart attack.Article 21(5) of the Sarawak Constitution requires the Election Commission (EC) to hold the by-election for the seat within 60 days.Adenan led BN to a big victory on May 7 last year, when BN won 72 of the 82 seats at stake.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...as-to-stay-out/"
