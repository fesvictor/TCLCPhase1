darthboyzzee,20170513,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"WAN AZIZAH’S DISASTROUS ALJAZEERA INTERVIEWRaja Petra KamarudinPKR President Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail should not have done that interview with Aljazeera (SEE THE INTERVIEW HERE). Whoever advised her to do that interview (or did not stop her from doing it) should be shot. They should have known by now that you should not trust Wan Azizah in front of a camera because her mouth moves faster than her brain. In America they would call her a ‘dumb blonde’.Never put a dumb blonde in front of a cameraThe interview was a most epic disaster and revealed not only the weaknesses in PKR and Pakatan Harapan but also how weak Wan Azizah herself is. She evaded answering many questions directly and veered off course when she had no answers. It shows she has absolutely no direction and is merely the proxy who makes no decisions but just carries out the decisions of others. She also contradicted not only what she said but what her party and Pakatan Harapan have been saying. That interview was one more nail in Pakatan’s coffin.Wan Azizah was asked why she condemned Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad earlier and said that ousting Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak would just be an exercise of replacing one devil (Najib) with another devil (Mahathir) and then now works with Mahathir.Wan Azizah skirted around the question and said that as long as they share the same objective of wanting to bring down the government then they can work together. In other words, the end justifies the means and working with one devil who is opposed to another devil is okay as long as your objectives are the same. This is precisely why America worked with the Taliban and with Saddam Hussein and why Lim Kit Siang now works with Mahathir after saying that Mahathir should be locked up in jail for the rest of his life.Wan Azizah’s Aljazeera interview was an epic disasterWhen asked whether Mahathir has ever apologised for jailing Anwar Ibrahim on what can be considered trumped-up and politically-motived sodomy charges, Wan Azizah said that Mahathir ‘almost admitted’, whatever that is supposed to mean (which is not what the question asked), and if Anwar himself can forgive Mahathir then she, too, has no problem working with Mahathir.The problem is, Anwar and Wan Azizah have never once publicly said that they forgive Mahathir. If, as Wan Azizah implies (without really stating), that they have both forgiven Mahathir, then they should categorically state this and not just imply without stating it. So, do Anwar and Wan Azizah forgive Mahathir? Say so!In fact, Mahathir himself said he does not need to apologise to Anwar (READ HERE). In that news report Mahathir said, “No, no, no. I didn’t apologise for anything. That was something in the past. We can’t be apologising for what happens in the past.” This contradicts what Mahathir said in 2005, which was, “Imagine having a gay prime minister. Nobody would be safe.”But do not blame Wan Azizah and Mahathir for these U-turns. Kit Siang and his son, Guan Eng, are also masters of U-turns, as the video below reveals. So Wan Azizah and Mahathir are just continuing the Pakatan Harapan tradition of doing U-turns every other day.ds9PNxu1iSAWhen asked what Pakatan is offering the voters, Wan Azizah replied good governance and no corruption and nepotism/cronyism. She then used Selangor and Penang as good examples — or what she calls ‘showcase’.But then there have been allegations of massive corruption in these two Pakatan states as well, until today. In fact, Selangor Menteri Besar Khalid Ibrahim was removed and replaced with Azmin Ali due to allegations of corruption and mismanagement of state resources, while Lim Guan Eng is awaiting trial on charges of corruption. And have not many wives and children of Pakatan leaders also been given party positions and positions in the state governments? Anwar’s, Kit Siang’s and Karpal Singh’s families are just three examples of political dynasties.When asked about the attempted no confidence vote in Parliament in October 2015 and why it failed, Wan Azizah went off-track and spoke about something else.Anwar said he supports Hudud and now Wan Azizah says the sameWan Azizah was then asked whether she supports Hudud and she replied, as a Muslim, she supports it. And then she made a most confusing statement that Hudud will not be implemented unless there is justice. She refuses to say ‘yes’ she supports Hudud or ‘no’ she does not support Hudud, echoing what Anwar said two years ago when asked the same question (which is he supports Hudud but the implementation needs to first be studied).And today this was what Anwar said regarding RUU355, which contradicts what DAP and its leaders are saying:“It is now clear that the PAS top leadership did not scrutinise the statements by PKR president and me over the RUU355 issue and that we respected the rights of Abdul Hadi to table the private member’s bill and suggested the matter to be referred to the Parliament Select Committee.” (READ MORE HERE)READ KIT SIANG CONTRADICTING ANWAR AND WAN AZIZAH HERE: Non-Umno BN leaders should resign if RUU355 tabled for debate in Parliament: Kit SiangOn the subject of her being a proxy Prime Minister and if she becomes Prime Minister it would only be to warm the seat for Anwar Ibrahim, Mukhriz Mahathir, or someone else, she did not deny that. She admits she is a seat-warmer and that she will resign once Anwar is able to take over and says there is nothing wrong with that. It was then pointed out that, due to his jail sentence, Anwar will not be eligible to be Prime Minister, and Wan Azizah did not rebut that. She more or less agrees that someone else other than Anwar might become Prime Minister because of that.She then veered off course again and spoke about the unjust judicial system, which is the reason why Anwar may never become Prime Minister. But she never said Anwar is innocent of sodomy. She did not, also, explain why over the last few years opposition leaders and anti-government activists have won more cases than they have lost. Looking at the list of cases they won versus the cases they lost, the impression given is that the judiciary is pro-opposition and most times rules against the government.In 2015, the Deputy Director of the Special Branch held a press conference to announce that he is anti-government-pro-opposition, just like the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and the Attorney General’s ChambersIn fact, the Attorney General’s Chambers and the MACC have both demonstrated its anti-government-pro-opposition bias many times. And so has the police force where the number two of the Special Branch held a press conference to announce that he is anti-government-pro-opposition.Wan Azizah’s Aljazeera interview was utter nonsense. However, the Pakatuns and Dapsters will think it was a great interview. But then what can you expect from these Pakatuns and Dapsters, especially those who are products of Chinese schools and a Chinese education system who cannot tell the difference between morality and immorality and do not comprehend the meaning of dignity and integrity. And this is one more reason why Chinese schools and a Chinese education system must be abolished: because it produces idiots like those Dapsters.http://www.malaysia-today.net/wan-azizahs-...eera-interview/"

darthboyzzee,20170514,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"Interview with Raja Petra KamarudinMalaysia Outlook talks to blogger and political observer Raja Petra Kamarudin to get a better understanding of his motivations and what he hopes to achieve by putting pen to paper, or rather, fingers to keyboard.Q: People say you are a turncoat. What do you have to say about that allegation?A: I first met the PAS President, Abdul Hadi Awang, in the 1970s. I think it was around 1977 or 1978 when he first came back from the Middle East. Since then I have had a good relationship with him and I became an active PAS supporter in Terengganu. In 1982 I was in Saudi Arabia together with Hadi. I even wrote for the PAS party newspaper when they started an English section in the 1990s. I still support Hadi and PAS until today, 40 years later. Hadi does not consider me a turncoat. He considers me a loyal friend. So who is it who is saying I am a turncoat? Hadi does not think so.Q: I think they mean you have betrayed Pakatan Harapan?A: I never supported Pakatan Harapan. So how can I betray something I never supported in the first place? I also do not support Pribumi and Amanah. Have I betrayed them as well? Hindraf is going to be turned into a political party and will be part of Pakatan, according to today’s announcement. So if I do not support Hindraf are you saying I have betrayed them as well? There is something very wrong with these people.Q: They say you are a mercenary who writes for money. They say you are paid to write?A: Are you saying all those reporters and writers in Malaysiakini, Free Malaysia Today, Malaysia Chronicle, Sarawak Report, The Malaysian Insider, Malaysia Outlook, The Malaysian Insight, and so on, are working free-of-charge? The Malaysian Insider cost the financiers RM13 million before it closed down while Free Malaysia Today has cost more than that so far. I was told Malaysiakini cost RM6 million a year and it has been in operation for more than ten years.Why does it cost that much? Are not all the writers and reporters working free-of-charge with no salary? Or is every single person in Malaysiakini, Free Malaysia Today, Malaysia Chronicle, Sarawak Report, The Malaysian Insider, Malaysia Outlook, The Malaysian Insight, etc., being paid a salary? Even Clare Rewcastle Brown is being funded. Do you think she can continue with Sarawak Report and fly all over the world and stay in five-star hotels if she is not paid? Will you do this job of interviewing me if you are not paid a salary?Why do Chinese not want to become policemen, soldiers, prison guards and so on? Simple. Because the salary is so low, less than RM1,000 a month. So they would rather sell pirated VCDs on the streets and make much more than RM1,000 a month. And these are the people who accuse others of working for money. These hypocrites are the very people who work for money and would not do the job unless it paid good money. They are so full of themselves and talk as if they are Mother Teresa. Even Mother Teresa needed money to do her job.Q: What do you hope to achieve with what you are doing?A: Over time, as life goes on, our priorities change. That is natural for everyone. When I was a teenager I only wanted to race motorcycles, party all night long and get drunk. I crashed my motorcycle 12 times but always managed to walk away from the crash. I also lost more than 10 friends who died in motorcycle crashes or gang fights. Yes, I was also ‘running’ with the triads in those days.Then I got married in 1973 and after we got our first child I wanted to build my career. One year later I went into business and was a businessman for 20 years until the 1990s. Over those 20 years from age 24 to age 44 all I wanted was to get rich. I spent all my time ‘chasing’ money and it did not matter how I made that money, by fair means or foul.But that contradicted my religious beliefs and it troubled me. I was heavily involved in corruption because you could not get large government contracts unless you paid for them. I won probably RM100 million or so government contracts over those 20 years and towards the end we were doing RM1 million turnover a month. But it was ‘dirty’ money because it involved under-the table payments.That was when my wife, Marina, pulled the plug and told me to get off the merry-go-round. So, in the 1990s, after 20 years of rolling in the mud, I decided to fight corruption instead of profiting from it. That was when I decided to become a writer and speak my mind. I have been doing that for the last 22 or 23 years.During the first 20 years of my life I just wanted to party. During the second 20 years of my life I was a capitalist and profited through corruption and by bribing government officers and politicians. During these last 20 years or so of my life I became a writer and later a blogger. So we change as we get older and our objectives also change.In the 1970s to 1990s I believed in the Islamic State and propagated turning Malaysia into a Caliphate or the Islamic Kingdom of Malaysia. In 1982 I even joined the Iranians in Mekah to demonstrate against the United States. There I was carrying Khomeini’s poster and shouting anti-American and anti-Saudi slogans. Looking back now I was lucky I was not shot because that happened the following year.Today those are no longer my objectives. What I hope to achieve is to educate Malaysians so that they become an informed voter. Most people do not know why they are voting. And that was what happened in the UK for the Brexit vote. Vote for whoever you want. Barisan or Pakatan. But know why you are voting Barisan or Pakatan. There is just so much hate in Malaysia. And one day that is going to explode and Malaysia’s streets are going to flow with blood.Q: You used to be pro-Anwar Ibrahim but now you criticise him. Why is that?A: I actually knew Anwar since school in 1963. But I became anti-Anwar in 1982 when he joined Umno. Then the ABIM boys in Terengganu approached me and asked me to help Anwar campaign for the Umno Youth leadership. I agreed and spent a lot of money to help the campaign. In 1991, Anwar became the Finance Minister and that was when we noticed the change in him. Anwar became what we were fighting against. He and his people were making deals left, right and centre. He became just like Mahathir Mohamad and Daim Zainuddin, who we were against.Many of Anwar’s ABIM comrades started to condemn him and began to distance themselves from him. When in 1993 Anwar challenged Ghafar Baba, that was when I washed my hands off him. I realised Anwar had become a monster and had turned into the very animal that we hated. We knew back in 1997 that after ousting Ghafar in 1993 Anwar was now going to oust Mahathir. And we also knew he was going to fail.True enough, in 1998 Anwar got ousted instead and we clapped and cheered. The first thing we said was, ‘Padan muka’. When the Reformasi movement ‘exploded’ we did not support it. We did not even join the 20th September 1998 demonstration, that day Anwar was arrested. We just stayed home and watched the fun.Then, when the PAS President, Fadzil Noor, supported the new Reformasi movement, we too started supporting it. And when they formed Barisan Alternatif in 1999 we supported it mainly because of PAS and not because of DAP or PKR (then called PKN before it merged with PRM). What people do not understand is that our loyalty is to PAS, not to DAP, PKR, Barisan Alternatif, Pakatan Rakyat or Pakatan Harapan. So when they kicked PAS out of the opposition coalition we no longer need to support the opposition. What about that do you not understand?http://www.malaysiaoutlook.com/interview-w...etra-kamarudin/"
