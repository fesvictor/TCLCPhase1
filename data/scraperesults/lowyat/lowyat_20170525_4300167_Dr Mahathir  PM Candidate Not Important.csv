The Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia chairman said anyone could be a candidate for the post but the most important factor is to win the election.  Asked to comment on a survey by PKR-linked research organisation Invoke in which Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim was the top choice for prime minister, Dr Mahathir said: ""He's one of the candidates. It's not confirmed yet.""  ""If we win, then we can name the candidate.  ""Kalau tak menang, bubuh nama syok-syok buat apa? Syok sendiri? (If we don't win, what's the point of giving names for fun. Is it for self- satisfaction?),"" the former premier told reporters after a Pribumi ceramah at Kelab Sultan Sulaiman in Kampung Baru here on Wednesday. Dr Mahathir and Pribumi president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin were caught in an awkward moment during the PKR national congress on Sunday when they did not join Pakatan leaders and PKR delegates in holding up placards bearing the words ""Anwar 7th PM"".  Dr Mahathir focused on his mobile phone while Muhyiddin merely smiled and clapped his hands.  During the ceramah, Dr Mahathir also said he was confident that the police were capable of maintaining peace and order if there is a debate between him and Tourism and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz.  ""Nazri tried to be a hero. He wanted to have a debate with me but at the last minute, said that the police did not allow it,"" he added.  Last Sunday, Nazri claimed that his proposed debate with Dr Mahathir was cancelled because several Umno leaders were instructed by police to lodge reports against the event.  Nazri said he was angered by the police action because the final impression given was that he had backed out of the debate, which was originally scheduled for March 25 at the Maktab Rendah Sains Mara in Kuala Kangsar.  Police, however, denied the organisers a permit.  The debate was then postponed to April 7 at the Karangkraf headquarters in Shah Alam, and had received an initial approval from police before it was withdrawn at the last minute due to ""security concerns"".  On Tuesday, Perak police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Hasnan Hassan lambasted Nazri for allegedly making false accusations against the police.  He said the claims were not true and he deemed them to be ""wild accusations"".http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...PZmzFq0FBW0l.99"
