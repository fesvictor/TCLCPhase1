scorptim,20170512,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 378,200911,,"The first 2 points, most people knew this from the start. If people wanted to vote a party which supports hudud, they would vote for PAS, not PKR. DAP and PKR are allies... That was known since.. What.. 10 years ago..  Everyday some joker will come in and keep claiming that UMNO will win the next election. Yet, even for ulang tahun also UMNO have to force UITM students to attend to gather enough crowd. So confident then bubar Parliament tomorrow la. Dun need talk so much."
