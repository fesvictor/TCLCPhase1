Eating out is expensive as one would imagine since salaries are higher.So, anything requiring services will be higher priced.I thought the freshwater fishes are pretty good. There is the barramundi which I thought compared to the Msian species is much better.Also, they tend to preserve it better. They do not have ice beds in Msian wet mkts, and that is hot weather. Whereas in Aus, they tend to have ice beds for their seafood layout, whether in wet or supermarkets. All in all, I think Aus quality is better. They try not to keep old stuff on the shelf. That is why you have the many weekly offers."
