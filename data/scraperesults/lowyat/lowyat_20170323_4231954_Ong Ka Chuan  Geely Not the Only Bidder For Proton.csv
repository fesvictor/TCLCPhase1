The International Trade and Industry Minister II announced this following news of Chinese carmaker Geely Automobile Holdings withdrawing its bid to acquire a controlling stake in Proton.""There are already a few other bidders at the moment, Geely is not the only one. They are currently trying to finalise the decision. As a private entity now, the Government cannot help Proton make the decision. ""We are only able to nudge them towards the direction in finding a strategic partner,"" he told reporters here on Thursday. With Geely pulling out of the bid, Ong said it was not the end of the road as Proton would continue to revamp their setup with the construction of their new main plant in Tanjung Malim, Perak. ""Consolidating Proton with a strategic partner from the international market would, no doubt, help build up the automobile industry. ""This would in turn, benefit Perak's business ecosystem, as local vendors supplying automobile services and spare parts would receive a much-needed boost,"" he said.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...ZHvUvPH87ylo.99"
