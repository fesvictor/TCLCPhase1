Some can even speak several Chinese dialects.""You won't go wrong if you choose Malaysia to invest in as we can serve as a window into Asean's market of 600 million population,"" he said during the Qionghai Residents Association's 10th inauguration dinner on Saturday.Dr Wee pointed out that Malaysia has a stable economy as it experienced a trade surplus for 235 consecutive months since 1997.""Also, in the last 15 months, our exports have increased by 32.5%,"" he said.With Malaysia's participation in the China-led Belt and Road initiative, Dr Wee urged those present during the dinner to consider investing in the country.""Let us not only link in terms of trade, but also with our hearts as well,"" said Dr Wee, followed by a round of applause from the floor.Qionghai is one of seven counties in China's Hainan province.The dinner was attended by those who could trace their ancestry back to Qionghai, which include guests from Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland and even the United States.Within the Chinese population in Malaysia, around 300,000 are of Hainanese descent.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...qRgtchz24TaX.99"
