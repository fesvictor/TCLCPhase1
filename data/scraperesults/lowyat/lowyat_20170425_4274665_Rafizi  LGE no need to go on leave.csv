Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng does not need to take leave over his corruption charges, PKR vice-president Mohd Rafizi Ramli said, despite the latter’s call for Ampang PKR Youth chief Adam Rosly to be relieved of this post.Rafizi said such matters should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and he argued that Lim’s corruption charges were merely political persecution, whereas Adam’s corruption charges were more straight forward.“In the case of Adam, I waited until the charges were brought against him, because I wanted to know what exactly are the charges. I think the explanation that he borrowed from Ah Long (loan sharks) to buy a bungalow is not going to be accepted by any sane person.“(Lim’s case) is political persecution. I have gone through (the case) and I have sat down with some of the lawyers. I think they will put a very good fight in court and I think the public will have a different perspective when it is presented in court,” Rafizi said at a press conference today.Yesterday, Rafizi issued a statement saying that Adam should be relieved of this post in the party, so to help PKR distance itself from “his personal problems”. He made this response today when asked whether Lim should take leave as well.Read more: https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/380231#ixzz4fF7NRz27"

I appeal to DAP to take the lead starting from Penang.“I appeal to DAP sec-gen Lim Guan Eng to take the lead, with his position as a chief minister, to make this his legacy in political reform,” The Star Online quoted Teh as saying at a news conference.Teh has previously made three unsuccessful attempts to submit his motion to the Penang state assembly to limit the tenure of the Penang chief minister to two consecutive terms.“Make this your legacy, while you still have the position. Not like Mukhriz.“Now he can only talk and is not able to act on it,” the DAP state lawmaker said, referring to Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia pro-tem vice president Datuk Seri Mukhriz Mahathir’s proposal to limit the prime minister’s post to two terms if they form government."
