But their citizens will all enjoy the same subsidised fees.”Kok also brought up the issue of entry requirements for the direct and non-direct intake of students for engineering programmes.She argued that if entry requirements were the same, students should not have to apply for the direct intake programme that costs RM90,000 compared to the non-direct intake programme that costs only RM12,000.“And if the entry requirements are different, where is the fairness?”According to the UM Engineering faculty’s website, the programme requiring the payment of full fees was called the international programme. Kok said that if this was the case, why was the programme not restricted to international students only.“Is this because Universiti Malaya’s Engineering faculty is not confident of attracting sufficient applications from foreign students?” Kok said.She said public universities played a different role from private universities in that it was a place where “poor students” could pursue a tertiary education at affordable rates.“A public university should not forgo such an important role.”http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...-as-foreigners/"
