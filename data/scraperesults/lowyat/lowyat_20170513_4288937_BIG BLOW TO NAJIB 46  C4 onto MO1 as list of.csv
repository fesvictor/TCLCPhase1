Instead, we should be assisting them in highlighting cases,” she told a crowd that included prominent activists, such as Marina Mahathir and the cartoonist popularly known as Zunar.Also present were Selangor state speaker Hannah Yeoh and veteran journalist R Nadeswaran, who were also among the panellist at the two-hour forum.This is where “Kleptocrazy Malaysia” will play a vital role, especially in keeping political leaders in check with the general election just around the corner.Gabriel, however, was quick to point out that the interactive platform was not to target personal individuals nor was there any personal vendetta attached to this initiative.Rather it will be a crackdown on public officials and politicians with unexplained wealth.“We want to go after those who live beyond their means. The main message here is that we are watching you.”The launch of “Kleptocrazy Malaysia” comes barely a month after C4 demanded the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act be amended to strengthen the commission’s powers to investigate corrupt practices, especially possession of unusual or unexplained wealth.The demand came following the arrest of PKR Youth leader Adam Rosly after allegations of his “unusual wealth” in April.He has since been charged under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act for providing forged documents as valid documents and giving false evidence.The launch also comes more than a month after Gabriel mooted an idea to get Malaysians to follow a “trail” of kleptocracy involving any political leader as a way to better scrutinise those holding power in government.Those interested in reporting suspicious wealth can do so at   kleptocrazy.my"
