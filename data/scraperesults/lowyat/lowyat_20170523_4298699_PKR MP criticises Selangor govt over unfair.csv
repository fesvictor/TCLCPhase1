A copy of the letter and attached audit report was delivered to my office on Feb 8, 2017.“The state treasury stated that they did an audit on my office on May 1-3 last year. However, at all material times, my office was not aware of the audit, as they did not visit our office. The audit was done mysteriously and without due process and natural justice,” Wong Chen said.He added that the audit findings allege that his office had failed to follow some guidelines.Wong Chen stressed however, that there are absolutely no allegations of misappropriation or corrupt practices in the audit findings.“Still, I feel strongly that my office has been denied natural justice and the right to be heard regarding the audit findings of not complying with guidelines.“Which is why my office immediately challenged the audit findings and provided a point by point rebuttal and also 4,000 pages of documents. My office also wrote four letters to the Selangor government authorities, all of which remain unanswered,” he said, explaining why he decided to go public on his grouse with the state government.“After receiving no action and no reply to my letters, my office issued a notice to the Selangor State Treasury that if it fails to either (a) retract the audit findings, or (b) conduct a fair and proper audit within 14 days, I will go public on the matter to defend the honour of my staff and my office.”Wong Chen said the mystery over the audit deepened when he found out in a meeting with Petaling District and Land Office district officer Mohd Misri on Feb 27 this year that the state treasury had also not visited their office to conduct any audit pertaining to the Kelana Jaya constituency.The first-time MP defended all expenditure by his office stating that all files were meticulously stored, with every record entered into the computer, helping to immediately extract the files, analyse them, and give a point by point rebuttal reply to all the audit findings.He said this was why despite every effort in providing feedback, documents and the response to all the audit findings, he was shocked when he heard from PKR colleagues earlier this month that his office had failed an audit.“I have written four letters to the authorities on this matter and received not a single official reply. I am not sure what the Selangor government protocol is when it comes to replying to letters from MPs in Selangor, but this stonewalling attitude is highly unprofessional and disappointing, to say the least.”Wong Chen said, he had also briefed his party leaders, including Selangor Menteri Besar Mohamed Azmin Ali, who is also PKR deputy president of his public disclosure on this audit issue."
