If none were brought up, I would assume that there were no differing views.“The Cabinet is an excellent platform to discuss various issues.“But the ministry has already made our stand clear on the matter – be it during internal or Cabinet meetings,” he said, adding that the ministry would not acknowledge the service.The ministry, Liow said, is very concerned over traffic accidents.“At present, 62.7% of road fatalities are made up of motorcyclists. This is too serious.“We feel this (allowing Dego Ride to operate) will increase the death rate. This is the basis for our decision,” he said.In an earlier report, Liow had said that under the Road Transport Act, motorcycles could not be used for commercial purposes.Dego Ride is an app-based motorcycle ride-sharing service, similar to Uber and Grab.The service began last November and at one point, had up to 6,000 motorcyclists participating in ride-sharing.Users could make bookings via WhatsApp and the rates were RM2.50 for the first 3km and 60 sen for each subsequent kilometre.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...Lq1BYfT9E2KH.99"
