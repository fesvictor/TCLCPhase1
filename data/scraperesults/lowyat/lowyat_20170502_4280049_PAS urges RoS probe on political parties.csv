Do they respect that?""Or Bahasa Malaysia as the official language, do they respect that?"" he said in his closing address to some 1,200 delegates at the PAS muktamar on Monday.Abdul Hadi said the RoS should probe the parties on other constitutional matters like whether they accepted the special rights of the bumiputra and whether they respected the nation's constitutional monarchy.Although the PAS president did not name any particular party in his speech, the Islamist party has in the past openly criticised its former ally DAP for disrespecting Islam.DAP, which is part of the Pakatan Harapan opposition pact, has also been accused by its rivals of having a party constitution that cares little for the position of the bumiputra in Malaysia."

But (it turned out that) they just wanted to use us for their own agenda,” he said, in likely reference to DAP and PKR which had cooperated with PAS in Pakatan Rakyat before the coalition was terminated in June 2015.MPs from DAP and PKR were also vocal in objecting to Hadi’s tabling of a motion on his private member’s bill to amend the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1965 (Act 355), which seeks to increase shariah punishments, in the Dewan Rakyat on April 6.“How can we agree with people who want to go against Islam?”Hadi also called on the Registrar of Societies to check if political parties in the country were holding true to the Federal Constitution.“Do they really respect Islam as the official religion? Do they really respect the Malay rulers? Do they really respect Bahasa Melayu as the official language? Do they really respect the special rights of the Bumiputeras?” he said in his speech at the Kedah PAS Complex at Kota Sarang Semut near here.Warning all legislators that they had taken an oath to uphold Islam as the religion of the federation, he said PAS would continue its vision of upholding Islam, which included pursuing the amendment of Act 355.He thanked the BN federal government for giving way to him to table the proposed amendments and said the Islamist party would never forget the cooperation they received in this matter.At a press conference later, Hadi reiterated that PAS would not allow itself to be used as a stepping stone for the schemes of any party or individual.He said PAS members implicated in such misdemeanours had either been sacked or had left the party of their own accord.Asked whether the gratitude he expressed to the federal government meant PAS was open to cooperating with BN in the near future, he said the party has been consistent that it would cooperate with anyone regarding the welfare of the people and would oppose anyone in matters that went against Islam.“As an example, we have objected to the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) (Amendment) Act 2016 because it was not suitable with the realities of Malaysia,” he said.Asked if PAS would enter into discussions with PH to ensure straight fights with BN in the 14th General Election, Hadi said it was unlikely as PAS had a strong foundation.“We can’t have discussions on (empty) air. We can’t do business on air. We have 165 divisions, we have 7,000 branches.“They (PH parties) don’t have divisions, they don’t have branches,” he said.“So we set up Gagasan Sejahtera,” he said, referring to the “third bloc” formed with Parti Ikatan Bangsa Malaysia (Ikatan) and Barisan Jemaah Islamiah Se-Malaysia (Berjasa).Some leaders of PH parties – comprising DAP, PKR, Amanah and Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) – have recently urged PAS to join forces with the opposition coalition to prevent three-cornered fights with BN on the reasoning that such contests would only benefit the ruling coalition."
