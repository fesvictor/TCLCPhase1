This is not being boastful because I am confident that together with my component party friends, we can win it back.""We want to present to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak and Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan the gift of victory for the Jelebu parliamentary seat and the four state seats,"" he told Bernama.Jalaluddin said the failure of the opposition to look after the interests of the people was one of the main factors for the change in support towards BN.He added that he hoped the strong team spirit between Umno members and the component parties will continue to ensure the party's victory in GE14, which is due by June next year.""Let us not be complacent, continue to help the grassroots,"" he said.In GE13, the Chennah seat saw a straight fight between Siow Foo Wen from BN and Anthony Loke Siew Fook from DAP.Siow lost to Loke by a majority of 1,098 votes.However, BN won other the three state seats, namely Sungai Lui, Klawang and Pertang, as well the Jelebu parliamentary seat. — Bernamahttp://www.thesundaily.my/news/2205882"

Donphatz,20170326,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,200901,From: PJ,I dont think they will. PAS is looking weak now. One day say with PH then next day said no. Pak lebai should just stay in Masjid and dakwah. Lebai and politics dont mix very well in current era.
