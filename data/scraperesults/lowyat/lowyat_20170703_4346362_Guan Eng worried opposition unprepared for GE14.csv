The coalition, however, increase its parliamentary representation to 89.Much has changed since then. PAS is no longer working with PKR and DAP, and are expected to be a third force in the next general election.If this is the case, the opposition's grip on Selangor will be on the rocks, as PAS has a significant presence in the state and could prove a stumbling block to the new opposition pact Pakatan Harapan.The split in the opposition could also cost PAS its stronghold of Kelantan, where BN is poised to capitalise on the Islamist party's battle against its splinter party and Harapan member, Parti Amanah Negara.Squabbles with PAS aside, Harapan itself is yet to forum consensus on various issues including role former premier Dr Mahathir Mohamad and his Umno-offshoot Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia would play in the coalition.Harapan has said it aims to finalise its leadership structure after Hari Raya Aidilfitri, which fell on June 25, but coalition insiders told Malaysiakini on Friday that no date has been set for a meeting yet."
