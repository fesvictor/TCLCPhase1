ironmaid89,20170710,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"With the resignation or demise of some of its delegates, DAP is dumbfounded over the mechanism to hold fresh polls for its central executive committee (CEC) members.Its secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said some delegates authorised to vote in the 2012 polls had either left the party or died.“One of them was former DAP chairman Karpal Singh. Don’t tell me we have to ask the late Karpal to come back and cast his vote?“We are mystified by the RoS’ statement that was issued four years after the polls in 2013,” Lim told a press conference yesterday after visiting the family of a deceased dengue victim in Kampung Dodol in Perak Road here.The party had first held its polls in December 2012, and a re-election in September 2013 due to the wrong tabulation of results through a computer spreadsheet.Last Friday, the RoS said while it had no intention of deregistering DAP, the party must hold fresh elections for its CEC members.Commenting on the directive, Lim said the party felt the move by RoS was politically motivated and claimed it was “a dirty tactic” by the registrar to cripple the party’s administration and jeopardise its preparation for the general election.“The general election is around the corner. Why did RoS not order us to hold fresh polls in 2014? Why now?” he asked.Lim said the party was still waiting for an official letter from the RoS regarding the need to hold fresh polls for its CEC.He slammed the RoS for issuing a statement on the matter before issuing the letter to DAP.“That itself is wrong and shows mala fide (bad faith),” he added.Lim said the party has not considered legal action against the RoS but wanted to meet the registrar to clear the air.DAP legal bureau chief Gobind Singh Deo said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who is also the Home Minister, should not be involved in any decisions made by the RoS which affect the DAP.“He should remember that he represents our opponent in the next general election,” he said in a statement yesterday.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...t4rAO0jV9oKC.99"

scorptim,20170710,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 378,200911,,Because they ask to do reelection based on 2012 list not new list.

Wanna reelect also must use new list with existing members ma right?

You got a list with 50 people, 10 are dead or have left the party. So you use the old list, majority is 25 votes but the 10 who have died or left the party can't vote. So technically you have to gather the 25 votes from 40 members instead of 50 members. This also have to spell out?Ros asked dap to use 2012 list, why not use new list with existing members?"

PappyBoyington,20170710,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"(Warning, long post below)TL;DR = don't rage at ROS because ROS just enforcing DAP constitution, acting on complaints from DAP membersThe excerpt is from CLAUSE VIII item 6 (page 12) of the DAP's party constitution.This item 6 specifically states that under their party's constitution, a minimum of 10 weeks notice must be given to all Branch Secretaries in writing of the date fixed with special reference to item 13.Item 13 states that  Branch Committee of a Branch entitled to send Delegates to the Party Congress shall be entitled to nominate up to twenty members of the Party to stand for election to the Central Executive Committee (CEC), such nominations should reach the Secretary-General not later than six weeks before the date of Party National Congress. HOWEVER, item 8 states that for in a Party SPECIAL Congress, notice must not be less than seven days before the date fixed.BUT nowhere was it mentioned in DAP's Party constitution that party CEC elections can be held in a SPECIAL Congress. The Party's constitution specifically states that a CEC election should be held in a National Party Congress - which is why item 13 specifically states this is where the branches can send their nominations list for the CEC election.Common sense tells you that for a matter as serious as a party's top leadership for the next 3 years would require more than just 7 days notice and should not be held in such a special congress.It would be unfair and very undemocratic.In July 2013, the ROS had instructed DAP to hold fresh elections to replace the ""excel-error"" and disputed party elections held in Dec 2012:On 22nd Aug 2013, the late Karpal Singh issued an official statement stating that DAP just only made a decision to re-hold the CEC elections as requested by the CEC and that it is only on the 26th Aug 2013 that they will hold a meeting to make the necessary preparations for fresh elections set for 29th Sept 2013, http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2013...deregistration/26th Aug or even 22nd Aug 2013 would not have fulfilled the 10 weeks minimum notice.In fact, to fulfill the minimum notice period of 10 weeks, the earliest you can send out the notice would be on 29th July 2013.Even as at 2nd Sept 2013, the ROS said that they have not received any letters from DAP on this 29th Sept re-election and had specifically warned DAP that the 29th Sept date will NOT fulfill the ROS requirements.http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/240015On 5th Sept 2013, DAP's Organization Anthony Loke said the party will submit their notification and necessary documents to the ROS.On 28th Sept 2013, - one day before  the elections, ROS issued a statement stating this:""In accordance with the DAP’s constitution, central elections should be held in a national congress with a 10-week notice given to branches and delegates. “If DAP presses on with its intention to hold fresh polls on Sunday in a special congress, they should change their party constitution first,.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2013...-ros-continues/Despite being forewarned by the ROS that the the Special Congress to hold elections will breach DAP's own constitution and that ROS will not recognize it, DAP went ahead to hold their 29th Sept 2013 re-elections anyway.Is it any surprise that this CEC is yet to be recognized? Therefore, it is not true that DAP was only told they had to hold fresh party elections four years later. It is probably more accurate to state that DAP has not complied with the directive even after 4 years.They were already told in July 2013 but the DAP appears not to have complied with the ROS requirements and their own party constitution.Why would anyone press on to hold re-elections despite already being forewarned by the authority in question that this re-election would be invalid and breaches their own constitution.As I had written before, defying the ROS and their own constitution gives more benefits to certain individuals in terms of the tenure to their position and to DAP in terms of sympathy votes .Eric See-To.----You can download DAP's own party constitution from the website at this link and see for yourself: https://dl.dapmalaysia.org/repository/DAPMa...pdf????"

Do not bar any eligible delegates from attending the meeting.All delegates then can reply to the invitation.If any of the delegates has been changed(for whatever reason), branches should give letter conforming the new delegates are genuine.If the delegates cannnot attend the meeting, count them as absent.Then, hold the CEC elections (date is 10 weeks after the notice).Make sure there is no error in microsoft excel because the delegates will report to ROS if any fraudulent element detected again."

Govt will be forced to back down or risk violence in the streets and possible censure from UN etc.2. Abide by ROS and hold CEC elections. LGE gets to be Sec Gen for another fresh term despite the two-term limit imposed by the DAP constitution. Domestic sympathy already there, GE is in the bag (for Penang at least) They can't lose lah.
