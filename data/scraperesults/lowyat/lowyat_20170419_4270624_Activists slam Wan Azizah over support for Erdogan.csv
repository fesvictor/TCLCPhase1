To say that pakatan is equal to erdogan is extreme but it doesn't help them in any possible way.It's funny to see that people are blinded by this fact because it is the opposition which can do no wrong.

No need to congratulate also i can see their hardcore supporters spamming support in fb supporting erdogan like a plague. The congratulation is a relatively non-issue. I thought ppl here always say why bother about other country when we are in shambles. Suddenly care so much about turkey.

SMB002,20170420,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 86,201501,,"It's true, Amos Yee certainly did not break the law. There's something called freedom of speech.Although what he said is definitely should be frowned upon, but to punish that with an actual form of physical punishment is definitely wrong.Said someone insults others, which caused him to be fired from his job or expelled from school. That's ok.But to impose fine, jailing or beat him up, that's wrong. There's line to such matter."

With regards to the obscenity charge, judge Jasvender Kaur said that ""standards of obscenity will change from time to time"", and differ among countries, and that ""it was up to the courts to decide based on community standards."" Kaur considered the effect that image had on teenagers, and concluded that it met the ""strongest possible disapproval and condemnation"". With regards to the second charge on making remarks intending to hurt the feelings of Christians, Kaur said that Yee's remarks were ""clearly derogatory and offensive to Christians"".He can't hide behind freedom of speech."
