Citizen72,20170405,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201703,,"Posting ""idli pictures"" does not connect him with any rakyat. Find ways to abolish GST and reduce unemployment then u will automatically  get connected with the rakyat. My point is, please post relevant things in india that you feel should be emulated here in Malaysia...not your favourite food."
