If you look at current development, not only one case a week, but up to two, three cases are investigated and prosecuted in court.""We will take action from time to time so I ask for support from all Malaysians as we only have a strength of 1,900 personnel and officers to keep an eye on 1.6 million civil servants,"" he said.He welcomed the statement from Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi that law enforcement officers under his ministry who asked for bribe would be arrested.Dzulkifli hopes other ministries would take proactive measures to nab the corrupt. - Bernama"

RoyMcAvoy,20170528,I'm much manlier than ur kpop/jpop wannabe bf,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,718",200301,"From: Middle Earth, KL","Korang penyokong pembangkang ni memang tak sabar dan bodoh kah?Didn't you see when the last time macc going for them? What happened? Everyone involved got transferred or relieved from duty and replaced with their own people. Now they need more time to re-group and re-strategize.It's a good strategy for macc to target the government officials because it's them, not the minister who have the power to approve all the tenders and such projects. Just imagine if none of the government officials is corrupt, how in the hell the politicians and ministers able to persuade them to do this outside the boundary of law? Then, eventually, these corrupt politicians will no longer have an influence upon the civil servants and they will leave the politic because they couldn't ""cari makan"" already with such incorruptible and high-integrity government officials. Eventually, good politicians will take their place sooner or later.Macc tactics now are brilliant. Fighting the corrupt politicians ""indirectly"" by cutting directly through their sources. It's okay to lose the battle now but in the end, we win the war."
