wankongyew,20170718,Regular,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,075",200711,,How is this politically motivated?  A deliberate honeypot trap? He's just an aide though not an MP himself.
ashestoashes,20170718,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,200905,,the court didn't give order for him not to approach victim. surely she will be safe?
