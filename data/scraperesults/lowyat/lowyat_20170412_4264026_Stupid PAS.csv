rulerhot,20170412,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201106,,"It has been narrated on the authority of `A'isha, the wife of the Prophet (?), who said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him):Messenger of Allah, has there come upon you a day more terrible than the day of Uhud. He said: I have experienced from thy people and the hardest treatment I met from them was what I received from them on the day of `Aqaba. I betook myself to Ibn `Abd Yalil b. `Abd Kulal with the purpose of inviting him to Islam, but he did not respond to me as I desired. So I departed with signs of (deep) distress on my face. I did not recover until I reached Qarn al-Tha`alib. Where I raised my head, lo! Near me was a cloud which had cast its shadow on me. I looked and lo! There was in it the angel Jibril who called out to me and said: God, the Honored and Glorious, has heard what people have said to thee, and how they have reacted to thy call. And He has sent to the angel in charge of the mountains so that thou mayest order him what thou desire (him to do) with regard to them. The angel in charge of the mountains (then) called out to me, blessed me and said: Muhammad, God has listened to what thy people have said to thee. I am the angel in charge of the mountains, and thy Lord has sent me to thee so that you mayest order me what thou desire. If you wish that I should bring together the two mountains that stand opposite to each other at the extremities of Mecca to crush them in between, (I would do that). But the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon Him) said to him: I rather hope that God will produce from their descendants such persons as will worship Allah, the One, and will not describe partners to Him.Reference	 : Sahih Muslim 1795In-book reference	 : Book 32, Hadith 135"

Tapi PAS bawah Hadi memang sudah Mati. https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/378764#ixzz4dvYxITZm'Child of PAP's shit''anak butir taik PAP' I don't see any reason that he has any quality of a leader. He is at the same level as Bijan. If he has any dignity, he should resign for uttering such words that a leader should not. If ex-DAP not even a leader Superman can resign for his racist and hatred speech, why shoudn't Hadi do the same ?Stop ruining PAS. Hadi does not represent Islam anymore after uttering such words not once but twice (or even more). I have lost count."
