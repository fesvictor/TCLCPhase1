alanyuppie,20170501,Look at all my stars!!,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 2,629",200607,From: here,They shot themselves in the feet then. Balasan tuhan means their god revengeful tahap setan....a tsunami easily taken tens of thousand lives ..from innocent newborns to kind adults. Hows that for maha penyayang higher power.If a flood or disaster still claimed to be gods way of cleansng evil...He sure failed science...coz half of the victims did nothing wrong. Marah nyamuk bakar kelambu.
nuvi,20170501,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 25,200908,,"You not seeing it from theist view. From theist view such disaster shows? god power and reinforce the belief. It does not give god bad name.Natural disaster happen to religion A. Religion B says religion A is misguided and god show his power to them. While religion A interpret the disaster is god showing? his power to test them, and they need to strength their belief. If a follower family die from the disaster and he blame god, other followers will see him as not having enough faith.In the end all religions strengthen their belief because of these natural disaster."
