WhyAmISoPoor,20170712,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,201606,,To be honest and neutral. Najib did a lot of things compared to mahathir. Just that he is more honest and not so good in hiding skeleton. He is more of an honest berterus terang type of leader.

Mikethebodo,20170712,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,201706,,"But compared to last time, today got so many people come out and say racing stuff in public. Not praising mamakthir lah, because he is the source of all this financial problems. But during his time, we always watch adverstisement and public shows of all the races holding hands and singing together to build the nation. Don't really see this kind of stuff nowadays. Except all the racing people coming out talking stuff to divide people. So if you say today is better than yesterday - be very afraid. Because it doesn't look good at all.The whole nation can go bankrupt but will always come out of disaster to be better if the people are united, as long as people come out racing, it doesn't look good, it demoralizes and divides a nation and people are too downtrodden to uplift the nation."

Otherwise as a premier, the finance minister will still report to you, so why need to take over such portfolio?2) As a premier cum Finance Minister cum 1MDumbee chairman, when will he take responsibility over the HUGE screw up on 1MDumbee. Not just alleged money laundering, but also the alleged wrong transfer of huge money into a wrong company account, is this childish game?3) Why reduced all other ministry budget (including education), but increase budget to his own ministry?

Half the country infrastructure destroyed by war.But 70 years later, look at Germany and Japan. They both are the top 5 economies of the world. SAP, BASF, Toyota, BMW, Bank Tokyo Misubishi, Hitachi, Sony, VW, Deutchland bank, etc.What builds a nation is UNITY among the people. But today do we see that? So many people come out racing from jamaak to katak. It is dividing the people and cause brain drain as more skilled people from the 3 major races, migrate overseas to work. So what is the difference between now and last time? We never see this kind of stuff happen during mamakthir time. Not praising mamakthir but one thing did not happen during his time was racing stuff.In fact during mamakthir time, he promoted a lot of unity, a lot of advertising and pictures and posters of all the people together smiling and waiving the bolehland flag."

powerlinkers,20170712,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,201706,,"My viewpoint1) in Malaysia: Finance ministry is the most important portfolio, placing another untrusted person would be able to dissolve ruling government if budget is not passed.    DS Najib majored in industrial economics: It would be wiser for him to place himself as the finance minister.    He has two boffin boys assisting him : Johari and Idris Jala: the economic policies implemented by them are set as an example for other countries to escape middle income trap by IMF.    We are expected to become a developed country by year 2020: No logical data by any international agencies and current economic growth trend would be able null the success of achieving high income nation in year 2020.2) Yes. agree with you: corruption involved mainly to siphon money for GE 13: He didn't have Mahathir backing who had billions and Mahathir prevented many of UMNO cronies not to donate money to Najib during GE13. 3) He has put highly intelligent people in his ETP and Pemandu : they are highly paid and they work with almost no bureaucracies : Huge amount of money is channeled for Malaysian development through his own Prime Minister's Department. Najib has failed to sack redundant ineffective high level government officers in other ministries.In Malaysian government, as long as you come to work: even if do not any work: people can't retrench you easily. Even those people who doesn't turn up for work: It takes almost 2 years for the government to fire them. This is an impossible task for any prime minister: Najib only limited new intakes.Najib is not perfect, but opposition would place Malaysia under the radar of socialism and collapse the economy. Please study Southern American socialist countries, especially Venezuela. Scandavanian countries would have been multiple times richer than USA if they didn't adopt socialist policies: make comparison 1950 and 2020."
