mekboyz,20170409,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 289,200704,From: Petaling Jaya,So I read that bijan will give rm1k if I also invest 1k into PRS fund. But is it like unit trust where you need to choose which fund to invest it? or like EPF where you just deposit to the bank fund and let them do it?And which bank got? I saw like PBB mutual/ cimb investment etc. Pls guide me sifu

LaiN87,20170409,Nom nom nom...,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,174",200301,From: ??? /b/PowerLvl:Over9000!,RM500 for invest for 1k.A lot of bank got. The main one is like you said PBB mutual is strong in unit trust but I'm using CIMB PRS as it's convenient since all my bank transactions are done within CIMB.Capital is not guaranteed but doesn't mean someone can't try to invest if they are trying to diversify their portfolio.Same like all unit trust or shares or even the house that you buy. Nothing is guaranteed.My CIMB PRS fund capital went up by 30% after the downfall last year.This is not including the 20% tax rebate that I receive up to RM3000 per year.https://www.fundsupermart.com.my/main/fundi...ass-C-MYCPPRS5CDon't give people wrong information based on your wrong perception.
