Their strong positions in the urban constituencies simply could not hand them the numerical strength in parliament,"" he added.This will also force the opposition, which is now more crowded with the entry of PPBM, to fight over a handful of constituencies, increasing the chances of overlaps that would be to BN’s advantage.Lure of stabilityAsri Salleh, a senior lecturer at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), said DAP will be hard pressed to deny the claim that it was the true power in the opposition, given the fact of its numbers as well as its leading role in the pact.Asri also believed that the efforts of opposition parties to reach out to Malay voters would be hobbled by Umno's portrayal of DAP's dominance, attributing this mainly to the opposition's divided and fractured state.""Regardless whether Umno's strategy is the right one or not, the fact that matters is that the effects can simply be amplified by folds due to the instability within the opposition,” he said.Malaysians, like most voters, prefer stability and are unlikely to be convinced by the currently erratic nature of the federal opposition, he explained.Although disapproving of the continuation of communal politics, he said it was a practice that has existed here since it was introduced by Malaysia’s colonial masters.""As such, I foresee nothing radical will come out of this current ‘battle’ between BN and DAP (Pakatan),"" he said.He said this precluded any possibility that the Chinese will be discouraged from backing DAP for fear of Malay reprisals, but added that the community will vote for whomever it felt would best serve its interests, even BN."

But then again, she never leads or take charge in anything besides her husband...Clearly LKS being close to Mahathir scares a lot of people. After looking at the DAP objectivity, I know they want to move to please more malay voters. But seeing some DAP members quitting could have some negative effect on Non-Bumi votes. How far, yet to be seen."
