I suppose he is pretty confident with his source or the information he possesses,” he said.He said Rafizi’s defence must be that the contents in the SD are true.“The truth will protect him from criminal prosecution and a defamation suit,” he added.He said even if the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) officer, who allegedly provided the information denies the matter, the onus is on Rafizi to prove the truth of the SD.Lawyer Mohamed Haniff Khatri Abdulla said Rafizi could also run foul of the law should he use a false SD in court proceedings.He said Section 200 of the Penal Code imposed a jail term of up to three years and also a fine, at the discretion of the court.Haniff said an SD was a sworn statement before a commissioner for oaths and could be tendered in court.He said Rafizi could be subjected to cross-examination to determine the veracity of its contents.“An SD will also have evidential value if the maker is not around. The court will decide the weight to be attached to the statement,” he said."
