Megadeth's concert here is in support of the band's latest album, Dystopia, their first in three years and fifteenth to date.The album earned a Grammy for Best Metal Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.Founded in 1983, the current Megadeth line-up comprises Dave Mustaine on vocals and guitar, David Ellefson on bass, guitarist Kiko Loureiro and drummer Dirk Verbeuren."
