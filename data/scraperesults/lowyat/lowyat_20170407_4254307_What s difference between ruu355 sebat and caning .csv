darosha,20170407,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 382,200301,"From: UM, KL, PJ, 14","even saudi and aceh also not doing the real hudud.real hudud would include stoning married adulterer to death which is shamed by international human right so as not to give the religion a bad name, they removed it from their hudud.by the way, hudud in aceh also not that easy to be done. the caning in public in aceh so far only 2 times. you know why? because they need 4 saksi. those who not sembahyang cannot be saksi. those even smoke cannot be saksi. and those not muslim are not punishable by hudud. so i dunno why non-muslim the one so many against it.ruu355 is just the pindaan inside perlembagaan for muslim to have right to have their own hukum syariah to be use. it is something already exist but its weak now, the 6 slash caning, the rm5000 is not a lot to some people, pas just want to enhance it to be more harsh, but its isnt even hudud yet and many already against it. for muslim to cant even enforce 'islamic' law to themselves, yup we're not merdeka yet"

RUU355 must not pass. There is no reason to strengthen what is wrong from the beginning. We should aim to completely get rid of it."

DaddyO,20170407,Regular,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,190",201108,,"Thats the excuse pas love to use. But do see the forest instead of trees. Having this bill passed will open flood gate for more syariah inclusion into the justice system. And it does affect non muslims even if indirectly. Just take a look at some of the islamic state here which already blanket ban alcohol and even entertainment outlets like cinema without consensus from non. Even places of worship for non has been limited even though they can non can still worship freely. McD ban non halal cake, cannot complain loudspeaker, introduction of halal trolley, women cannot wear knee length skirts.......all that affects non. So do use own brain a little insteaf of just following blindly what idiots like pas said who could have used religion for selfish gain."

Only think i can say which may not offense you is to go home to Isis state.
MRaef,20170407,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 98,200511,,"I believe why non Muslim oppose to this particular RUU is because of the outcome. If this RUU passed, it can be a pretext to more Syariah law to be amended or expanded which sooner or later will affect non Muslim too."
DaddyO,20170407,Regular,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,190",201108,,There is never such a thing as one law for muslim and another law for non. Sooner or later extremist will force to make one law more superior and create another Isis. But of course people like pas supporters would love that outcome.
Exiled_Gundam,20170407,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 531,200701,,"RUU335 only made the punishment under Syariah Law harsher. What considered as crime under Syariah Law and how it was enforced still same like right now. Stuff /k complained about the motion is actually about the Syariah Law (which is already in effect with or without ruu335), not the motion itself."
DaddyO,20170407,Regular,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,190",201108,,"People talking about the overall effect that can propagate to more ridiculous syariah law that will encroach non-muslim rights directly or indirectly, you people keep dialing back to ""Oh but it only affect muslims"" nonsense. If you want to punish evil doers, there is already civil law in place so why the need for another law. Syariah law in essence is also man-made law, otherwise how you explain people like Hadi can simply change god's punishment to his wimp and fancy? If you still think Islam is about compulsory support syariah law, then you are literally just worshipping Hadi like an idol."
