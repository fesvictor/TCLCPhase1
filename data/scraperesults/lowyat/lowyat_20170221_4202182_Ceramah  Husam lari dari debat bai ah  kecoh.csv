I'm sure PAS leader could control the crowd there if they really tried. Of course his action of going to the stage and sitting on the chair uninvited are misbehaved as he mean to provoke the people there. But PAS could be the better person here and at the same time showed how they could handle him instead. I think if PAS challenged him to debate there and then he also would not be prepared to do so but he already predicted that he will be escorted out and PAS just did what he expected. This is a perception war actually, what the result shown to outsider is that PAS could not control his people and Husam is brave enough to go to there alone."

Senang cerita;Hudud == IslamIslam != HududKebanyakkan penyokong PAS hari ni ingat bila laksana Hudud maka lengkaplah Islam mereka, lengkaplah Malaysia sebagai negara Islam tetapi realitinya tak sedemikian. Islam bukanlah satu destinasi yang perlu dituju akan tetapi ialah adalah process atau perjalanan itu sendiri yang tiada kesudahan sampailah kita dipanggil pulang kepada pencipta kita. Wallahualam."

darthboyzzee,20170221,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"More Kopi pess! Sedap.   10 fakta apa itu sumpah bai'ah PasNIK MUHAMMAD ZAWAWI NIK SALLEH - Foto Sinar Harian oleh SHARIFUDIN ABDUL RAHIMSEPULUH fakta yang masyarakat perlu tahu tentang apa itu bai'ah yang dilafazkan oleh ahli dan wakil rakyat Pas. Pengertian mengenai bai'ah ini dikongsikan oleh Setiausaha Majlis Syura Ulama Pas, DATUK DR NIK MUHAMMAD ZAWAWI NIK SALLEH kepada Sinar Online dalam satu wawancara khas semalam.1. Definisi bai'ah Pas ?Menyentuh topik yang dinamakan bai’ah di dalam Pas sama sebagaimana bai’ah yang dirujuk dalam Fiqh al-Islami , di dalam sirah Nabi Muhammad SAW, Rasulullah mengadakan bai’ah antaranya Bai’ahtul Nisa, Bai’atul Ridwan, Bai’atul Aqabah dan banyak lagi bai’ah-bai’ah yang lain, yang dilaksanakan oleh Rasululllah dengan tujuan supaya umat Islam ini terikat dengan dasar-dasar yang diperjuangkan oleh Islam, dan umat Islam ini terikat dengan peraturan yang ditetapkan oleh Rasulullah, walaupun peraturan itu kadangkala sangat mencabar seperti perkara yang membabitkan peperangan antara Islam dengan musuh Islam jadi bai'ah ini dibuat supaya ia mengikat para sahabat ini, maka Rasulullah memperkenalkan satu sistem yang dinamakan bai’ah. Jadi kita sebagai parti Islam kita ambil semangat daripada sirah ini, untuk kita laksanakan didalam parti kita kerana parti kita Pas ini sangat berpengalaman dari segi pelbagai isu... masalah dan macam-macam perkara jadi kita ambil faedah bai’ah ini untuk diperkenalkan dalam Pas supaya pimpinan dalam parti kita tahan menghadapi ujian sama ada ujian berbentuk dalaman mahupun berbentuk luaran.Jadi sebab itu bai’ah yang kita perkenalkan ini adalah salah satu daripada sunnah yang dilakukan oleh Nabi Muhammad SAW.2. Jenis bai'ah dalam Pas ?Dalam konteks Pas,  bai’ah ini ada dua yang pertama bai’ah kepada ahli umum apabila mereka ini mengisi borang Pas.Jadi walaupun kita tidak namakan ia sebagai bai’ah tetapi bila mereka mengisi borang Pas ini mereka  mengakui dengan nama ALLAH, mereka mengakui bahawa masuk di dalam Pas ini untuk dia menegakkan syariat Islam.Walaupun berhadapan dengan pelbagai isu sama ada isu dalaman atau luaran, supaya ahli (boleh) tahan, kita (Pas) ikat mereka dengan bai’ah.Ada pun peringkat kepimpinan terutama sekali pemimpin yang dipilih menjadi calon di dalam Pas kerana di dalam konteks negara kita ini banyak aspek yang akan mencabar calon-calon ini seperti isu membeli calon,  isu lompat parti, isu khianat parti, jadi kita dalam Pas hendak supaya parti Pas ini berbeza dengan parti-parti yang lain, maka kita ambil inpitati daripada sunnah ini kemudian kita laksanakan di dalam parti kita.Kita buat bai’ah untuk mengikat calon kita biar mereka lebih istiqamah dengan perjuangan Islam kerana memang perjuangan Islam ini satu perjuangan yang banyak menghadapi ujian tetapi bila kita ikat mereka dengan bai’ah Insya-ALLAH calon ada ketahanan dan sebelum bertindak, mereka akan ingat apa janji dengan parti, janji dengan bai’ah yang dilafazkan sebelum daripada masuk bertanding dalam pilihan raya.Untuk ahli, kita tidak namakan sebagai bai’ah secara umumnya, kita tidak rasmikan namanya sebagai bai’ah tetapi bila mereka isi borang Pas itu maka mereka memahami janji dengan Pas untuk patuh kepada segala peraturan parti dan kita kaitkan perkara ini dengan nama ALLAH, Nabi maka bila satu perjanjian dikaitkan dengan ALLAH dan Rasulnya maka perjanjian ini namakan sebagai bai’ah manusia dengan ALLAH adapun bai’ah membabitkan calon-calon yang bertanding ini perlu saya perjelaskan bahawa, bai’ah ini kita bagi pilihan kepada orang yang hendak bertanding atas tiket Pas, kalau calon merasakan bahawa mereka hendak bertanding atas tiket Pas kita mengatakan dalam Pas ada bai’ah, jadi kalau dia hendak bertanding dan dia tengok bai’ah itu, dia restu dengan bai’ah itu, dia kena patuh dengan bai’ah dan kalau dia tidak hendak dengan bai’ah ini, jangan bertanding atas tiket Pas, bolehlah bertanding atas tiket mana-mana sahaja.3. Jika langgar bai'ah ?Jadi sebab itu isu melanggar bai’ah ini adalah isu yang besar kerana bai’ah ini adalah pilihan daripada individu itu sendiri, bukan parti yang paksa... dia bebas kalau dia hendak bertanding sahaja, kalau dia tidak mahu bertanding tidak mengapa, kalau dia hendak guna parti lain tidak mengapa, tapi apabila hendak bertanding atas tiket Pas dia kena faham bahawa dalam Pas ini ada bai’ah ada janji setia untuk mengikat mereka ini dengan perjuangan Islam supaya mereka tidak tergopoh-gapah, istiqamah dengan perjuangan Islam, jadi bila dia berbai’ah dengan Pas dia kena akur bai’ah ini janji dia dengan ALLAH yang paling besar.Calon  ini  menyebut sumpah dengan nama ALLAH, nama Nabi dan malaikat, sekiranya dia khianati apa yang diamanahkan ini dia akan dilaknat oleh ALLAH, malaikat, sekalian  makhluk yang boleh melaknat.4. Garis panduan lafaz bai'ah ?Di dalam Pas, Majlis Syura Ulama memutuskan bahawa lafaz yang dilafazkan di dalam bai’ah itu satu lafaz.  Cuma kita dapati beberapa negeri ada yang menambah lafaz, jadi Majlis Syura Ulama kita tidak menghalang apa yang hendak ditambah itu  kerana di dalam bai’ah ini kita tengok bai’ah yang dilakukan oleh Rasullullah pun ada berbeza misalnya Bai'atul Nisa berbeza dengan Bai'atul Aqabah.Jadi bila kita meletakkan satu lafaz maka lafaz itu digunapakai oleh semua wakil-wakil rakyat hampir semua negerilah kecuali saya difahamkan di Kelantan dia menambah sedikit dalam bai’ah dan kita dalam Majlis Syura tidak menghalang tetapi lafaz yang diluluskan oleh Majlis Syura Ulama adalah lafaz yang jelas antara intipatinya janji supaya tidak mengkhianati parti, tidak mengkhianati amanah yang diamanahkan oleh calon Pas.5. Bila bermulanya bai’ah ? Waktu Pas mula-mula ditubuhkan dulu tidak ada bai’ah sebab dulu ujian tidak besar dan orang bertanding dalam pilihan raya dalam Pas ini dulu orang tak bercakap akan menang sekiranya bertanding sahaja, cuma tidak mahu Umno menang percuma.Saya masih ingat ketika saya masih kecil,  orang kampung cari duit untuk beri kepada calon Pas semata-mata tidak mahu memberi Umno ini menang percuma.Jadi zaman dulu tidak timbul masalah hendak beli calon, hendak hasut,  tidak timbul masalah  jadi zaman itu.. tiada bai’ah tetapi apabila ALLAH bagi kekuatan kepada perjuangan Pas kita melangkah selangkah demi selangkah sekarang ini bila sebut sahaja kita bertanding dalam pilihan raya maka orang boleh sebut kemungkinan besar Pas akan menang.Apabila menampakkan semakin hari (Pas) semakin kuat , maka sudah tentulah andaian yang kita takut, berlaku dalam kepimpinan dalam Pas ini... lompat parti ke… walaupun Alhamdulillah kita parti yang paling bersih berbanding dengan parti-parti lain berkenan dengan lompat parti ini tetapi macam mana pun kita perlu berwaspada sebab itulah kita meletakkan bai'ah dalam Pas.6. Ada calon yang pernah tolak untuk berbai'ah ?Sepanjang pengalaman saya tidak ada  calon yang dicadangkan menolak bai’ah…. dan tidak ada seorang calon yang menolak untuk berbai’ah dalam Pas.Sebab kalau dia (calon)  tolak….. dia kena tengok dulu kalau hendak bertanding atas tiket Pas, ini dia kena berbai'ah kalau setuju sila, kalau tidak setuju dia jangan bertanding… semua calon bertanding semua berbai'ah, bila hendak bertanding dia kena setuju, kalau buat sesuatu yang bercanggah dengan Pas dia dikira mengkhianatilah.7. Wujud bai'ah talak tiga ?Bai'ah talak tiga ini Masjlis Syura tidak menghalang,  cuma lafaz dikeluarkan Majlis Syura tidak ada kandungan itu. Tetapi kita tidak menghalang mana-mana negeri mungkin semangat untuk menjaga kuasa pemerintahan yang ada di Kelantan mungkin dia tekankan, Tok guru (Allahyarham Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat) jika dia saksikan dia adalah Mursyidul Am, orang paling besar dalam Majlis Syura Ulama, jadi kalau dia restu isi kandungan tersebut, maka hak negeri dan hak Mursyidul Am kerana umumnya lafaz bai’ah ini dia tidak ada nas qat'i.. sebab itu Rasulullah pun berbeza .. Baiah'tul Ridwan lain, Aqabah lain, bai’ah lain lain ikut keadaan, ikut suasana.Cuma yang saya sebut Majlis Syura Ulama tidak ada talak tiga ini, cuma kalau ditambah di peringkat negeri itu adalah hak yang tidak dihalang oleh Majlis Syura Ulama.Maksudnya mungkin tidak ada taklik talak tiga, setakat ini saya ingat tidak ada di negeri lain cuma rasa di Kelantan sahajalah.8. Komen bila Mufti Perlis dan Pulau Pinangs katakan bai'ah talak tiga Pas tidak sah (tidak jatuh taklik)Bila dia sebut taklik ini tidak sah, dia punya ayat itu sangat jelas.. mana dia tahu hati orang, mufti ini bila dia tahu hati orang, ayat itu sudah tidak betul.Saya nasihat agar mufti bercakap dengan ilmu dan orang yang layak untuk bercakap dalam isu perjuangan Islam adalah orang yang duduk dalam saf perjuangan Islam, jadi kalau orang yang dalam perjuangan Islam tidak terlibat, tidak faham jadi tidak payah bercakap dalam isu ini, kalau dia tidak sempurna dia tak payah cakap berdiam lebih baik.9. Bagaimana hendak elak jatuhnya talak tiga ini ?Saya sarankan agar isteri calon-calon tersebut memainkan peranan agar menasihati suami dia, beri nasihat supaya jangan buat tindakan-tindakan yang orang panggil tidak beretika,  tidak ada moral dalam konteks perjuangan ini.Hatta orang bukan Islam yang berjuang pun mereka tidak berganjak daripada parti mereka walaupun komunis, mereka ada integriti, orang Jepun tidak berganjak, kalau kita dakwa kita pejuang Islam, tiba-tiba hendak berganjak. Oleh itu isteri mereka orang yang paling rapat dengan suami, nasihat suami, pujuk dia supaya dia tidak bertindak sebagai mana yang dia hendak bertindak.Nasihat yang paling sesuai kerana akibat sangat buruk, kalau orang yang langgar bai’ah ini akibat sangat  buruk kita bimbang dalam rumah tangga tiada keberkatan, anak-anak tiada keberkatan jadi menyusahkan dia sendiri. Kalau dia berbai'ah dia memang jatuh talak kerana kuasa cerai itu ikut pada suami, jadi isteri jangan diam, pergi rujuk mahkamah syariah, paling praktikal cakap dari hati ke hati, beritahu suami agar berfikir panjang supaya tidak berlaku perkara yang tidak diingini, kalau berlaku memang jatuh talak.10. Nasihat kepada rakan-rakan yang seolah-olah hendak langgar bai'ah dan tubuh parti baharu.Jangan sesekali sesiapa melanggar bai’ah dengan ALLAH, mengkhianati jemaah, dalam sejarah perjuangan,  minta maaf saya tidak mahu sebut nama sesiapa… tetapi dalam Pas orang yang langgar bai’ah yang cuba keluar parti semua sekali, saudara boleh tengok macam mana kedudukan mereka dunia ini.Dia tidak dihormati dan kadang-kadang kita lihat individu  itu berhadapan dengan kesusahan yang banyak…. kerana apa?Kerana apabila kita langgar perjanjian  ini dengan umum semua makhluk  yang boleh melaknat akan laknatnya termasuk ALLAH, malaikat lebih daripada itu di hari akhirat …Satu benda yang sangat besar, jadi sebab itu dalam kesempatan ini saya hendak nasihat kepada kawan-kawan semua yang cuba hendak tubuh parti baharu, saya ingatkan perjuangan Islam ini tidak akan tergugat… kerana perjuangan Islam ini dijaga oleh ALLAH sebab itu dalam sejarah parti politik mereka yang tidak perjuangkan Islam ini mereka akan hanyut habis begitu sahaja. Atas nama kawan, saya sangat simpati kadang-kadang saya rasa kasihan walaupun  kadang-kadang mereka lebih umur daripada saya, saya hendak nasihat kepada mereka agar kembali ke pangkal jalan. Kalau ALLAH boleh ampunkan dosa Saidina Umar Al-Khattab,  kita dalam Pas boleh maafkan kesalahan dan kesilapan dan balik ke pangkal jalan.. kami pun tidak untung apa.Cuma kita kasihan mereka yang bertindak di luar batasan agama tidak akan selamat, di dunia ini dihina oleh orang masyarakat, kita mati jawab di hadapan ALLAH satu benda yang sangat besar.Saya mengharapkan supaya semua kawan balik semua ke jalan Islam, kalau mereka hendak keluar tubuh parti cubalah mereka jawab, yang pertama parti yang ditubuh mereka itu, mereka berpegang pada ayat mana, surah mana kerana perjuangan Islam ini hanya satu.http://www.sinarharian.com.my/politik/10-f...ah-pas-1.413201"

neoexcaliber,20170221,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,"I'd like to copy paste this excerpt of an article from The Star.   The ceramah, titled ""Husam lari dari debat baiáh (Husam running away from oath of loyalty debate)"", was held outside the Sultan Muhammad IV Stadium on Monday night.Husam surprised everyone when he arrived at the ceramah alone at about 11pm. He walked up to the stage and sat with PAS leaders behind the invited speakers, who included Kelantan PAS information chief and exco member Datuk Nasurudin Daud and Keterah PAS chief Wan Ismail Wan Jusoh.While Nasurudin was speaking, a member of the audience appeared at the side of the stage and challenged Husam to debate on the issue.The situation quickly turned into a shouting match between Parti Amanah Negara supporters of Husam and those from PAS. It was only after security guards urged Husam to leave the stage that the situation returned to normal. Husam, who saw the tense situation, left the stage but mingled with the crowd while Nasurudin continued with his attacks. Husam then proceeded to a shop in front of Kota Darul Naim (the state government complex) where he explained that he was invited to the ceramah by a member of the organising committee.""I was invited to the ceramah and that was why I came in the hope of debating with Nasurudin. http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...-to-attack-him/"
