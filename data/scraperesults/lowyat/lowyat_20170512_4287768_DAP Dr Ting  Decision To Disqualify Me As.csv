ironmaid89,20170512,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"Dr Ting (seated, second left) holds a press conference after the decision to disqualify him from DUN.Disqualified Pujut state assemblyman Dr Ting Tiong Choon slammed the decision to kick him out of the august House today, saying it was “invalid” and that it “set democracy in the state back 30 years”.A vote taken in the State Legislative Assembly (DUN) sitting today saw a 70 to 10 majority to disqualify him in the ministerial motion filed by Minister of International Trade and E-Commerce Dato Sri Wong Soon Koh.“There is no concrete evidence to disqualify me as a wakil rakyat, apart from a post on the internet (that led to) disqualifying my election,” he said in a statement to The Borneo Post shortly after the motion was allowed by DUN Speaker Datuk Amar Mohd Asfia Awang Nassar.“I think it is invalid to disqualify me in the DUN as the public knows that an election petition against me was null and not valid,” he said.He said he was caught by surprise and only came to know about the motion at about 10am during the question-and-answer session itself.Wong, in tabling the motion, alleged that Dr Ting had dual-citizenship, while he instead dismissed it as information “obtained only from the internet”.“I was surprised and did not know a motion was set against me as an elected representative of Pujut by the people. I strongly condemn the motion and the BN government for using the DUN sitting to force me out,” he said.He said the Opposition was simply outgunned by the 70 BN representatives who supported the motion against 10 from the opposition camp, saying the motion was an affront to the democratic process and had “turned it back 30 years”.He will be consulting his family and party on his next course of action.http://www.theborneopost.com/2017/05/12/dr...tform=hootsuite"

As easy as yes or no. Then afterward can claim this and that or can ask immigration or that country immigration to check whether there is basis to that allegation.Always trying to be in the grey area - marah or tak puas hati people do this and that base on allegation, but never say whether the allegation is true or not."

Parrot,20170512,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 418,200704,From: Somewhere. Isolated from the rest of you pukes.,"Although you can still hold dual citizenship without incident if you are discreet about it, it's technically illegal and you can be prosecuted when you're public about it or if you hold an important position in the Opposition where everything you do could be used against you to smear your credibility (even if you renounced it). I can't say he didn't deserve it. He was an elected lawmaker, FFS. He should had knowledge of the law.My only gripe is that the gomen might view this as an abuse of the system and tighten dual citizenship rules, which wouldn't be good for people looking to put one foot out."
