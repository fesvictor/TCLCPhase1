Dr Wan Azizah, who is PKR president and Anwar’s wife, would then help her spouse to be released from prison and a by-election would be held to make Anwar a Member of Parliament, and subsequently PM, Rafizi explained. * i thought malaysia has a thing called separation of powers. Is he saying that PH gov will coerce the supreme court to release anwar? Even if you dont agree with sodomy law, that outdated is still a Malaysian law. “People say PKR is delusional in claiming Anwar is PM when he is still sitting behind bars but it is possible.“Wan Azizah will be interim PM and then Anwar will be PM. I am confident that she can help him to be released and a by-election can be called for in a month or two to make him PM,” he said during his wrap-up speech at the PKR congress today.Rafizi also stressed that the only reason Anwar was imprisoned was because he had been “victimised by political enemies”.He also echoed Dr Wan Azizah’s call for the people to make Anwar PM, saying they were indebted to Anwar for his sacrifice.The Pandan MP also shot a warning to his party leaders to always remember Anwar as he was the one who helped them rise in their political careers.“When we go back to our constituencies, we are indebted to Anwar. If it wasn’t for him, we won’t have our seats.“We have to repay back his gratitude by making him PM,” Rafizi stressed. - See more at: http://m.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/a...h.Wm4eDlzX.dpuf"
