kaffra,20170216,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 602,200410,From: Deutschland,"Im guessing RPK is among the key RBA that left and now part of najibs boffin boys ?--Yesterday, Kit Siang lamented that DAP’s Red Bean Army has been defeated by Najib’s Boffin Boys. What took ten years to develop was demolished in just two years. So DAP now no longer monopolises the internet like it used to.Just to digress a bit, it seems some of the key players in the RBA have left because they were not being paid enough like when DAP’s Black Ops first started in 2004.This is like a prostitute calling another woman a whore. It was DAP that started the whole operation in 2004, which ‘exploded’ in 2008 when DAP suddenly ‘owned’ Penang and with it lots of money. And now DAP is merely getting a taste of its own medicine. Somehow, though, Kit Siang does not like the taste of his own medicine, which was the reason for his blog posting yesterday.And that is what really upset Kit Siang, as you may have noticed from his blog posting yesterday. For ten years from 2004 to 2014 DAP developed its Red Bean Army cyber-trooper operation. And in just two years, from February 2015 to February 2017, Najib’s Boffin Boys demolished their operation. And Kit Siang has more or less conceded defeat in his blog posting yesterday.http://www.malaysia-today.net/kit-siang-ad...-army-defeated/"
