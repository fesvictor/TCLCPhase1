I'm sure Maduro supporters have their reasons too, but they're shitty stupid ones."

Previously I voted for PKR/PAS, but with the recent drama, PAS will get 0% of my vote. Honestly I do wish for a stronger opposition, but it seems there is no good prospect. They had their best chance in the last GE, and they blew it, no thanks to BN fixed deposit.Feels its easier to clean out BN from the inside and replace old farts with better people, SMARTER people."

But at least they can advice the young generations on what to avoid when becoming a people rep. Pak Lah was so different to what Tun Mahathir was. At one point, I felt like any neighbouring country could conquer Malaysia during his reign. But I also felt pity for him having to wipe off Mahathir's debt."
