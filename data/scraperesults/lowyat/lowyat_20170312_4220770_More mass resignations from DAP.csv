PappyBoyington,20170312,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"They felt that DAP has strayed from its principles. No mention of dedak though -----Malacca DAP today suffered a second wave of resignations, after the departure of veteran member and its sole MP, Sim Tong Him and three state assemblypersons last month.Some 182 grassroots members, led by seven former DAP state committee members, quit citing ""disappointment"" with the party.Among others they said the party deviated from its ""Malaysians Malaysia"" principle, former Malacca DAP state secretary Liou Chen Kuang said.Besides Liou, the six other former state committee members leading the resignations are N Ghandi, Low Chew Lim, Henry Kang, Kenny Tam, Kng Tuan Hock and Tee Ai Yen.Liou also criticised the DAP for ""selling out Chinese honour"" to gain votes for power, alleged failure to weed out internal corruption as well as claimed interference of central leadership in state party matters.“We decided to take this decision after a month of consideration and consultation with local supporters and members.“The 182 members decided to renounce the party membership as DAP has deviated from its struggle,” Liou, who joined DAP 18 years ago, told Malaysiakini.However, DAP state secretary Khoo Poay Tiong denied the party has deviated from the ""Malaysian Malaysia"" principle and urged the members to reconsider their decision.""As I understand, they (the disgruntled members) will courier their resignation letters to the central leadership.""If they have not sent (the letters) out, I urge them to please cool down and reconsider it,” the Ayer Keroh assemblyperson said when contacted."

BN,MCA, MIC, PAS, all change their leader in some time..but DAP seems stuck since 1960s & still rely on LKS dynasty like DAP will be dead if LKS dynasty fallits time to change..but this time, make DAP top leadership change 1st..no use talk to rakyat about change when the very same party itself scared to change their top leadershiplead by example"

PappyBoyington,20170314,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/375519Lim: Nampak macam 20 orang saja keluar DAPSetiausaha Agung DAP, Lim Guan Eng tidak percaya seramai 182 anggota akar umbi DAP di Melaka mengumumkan keluar daripada parti itu, semalam.Lim berkata, berdasarkan gambar yang dimuat naik ke media sosial, beliau tidak 'nampak' 182 orang meninggalkan parti itu, sebaliknya hanya sekitar 20 orang berbuat demikian.“Ada 182 ke? DAP ada 150,000 ahli. Kami menilai dan menghargai kesemua ahli-ahli kami dan daripada 150,000 ahli, yang saya nampak dalam gambar hanya 20 lebih sahaja.“Tapi yang 20 orang dalam gambar yang dilaporkan dalam media BN mungkin boleh jadi 182,” katanya kepada pemberita di lobi parlimen hari ini.Semalam seramai 182 anggota DAP Melaka mengumumkan keluar parti bagi mengikut jejak langkah Ahli Parlimen, Sim Tong Him bersama tiga ADUN lain yang berbuat demikian bulan lalu.Mereka diketuai tujuh bekas anggota jawatankuasa DAP negeri bertindak demikian selepas mendakwa berasa 'kecewa' dengan parti itu.Antara lain mereka mendakwa DAP menyimpang daripada prinsip ""Malaysian Malaysia"", kata bekas Setiausaha DAP Melaka, Liou Chen Kuang.Mengulas lanjut, Lim yang juga ketua menteri Pulau Pinang berkata mereka yang keluar DAP mungkin berasa hampa selepas kalah dalam pemilihan parti sebelum ini.Katanya, beliau berharap mereka akan kekal dalam DAP tetapi tidak dapat menghalang jika mereka ingin meninggalkan parti itu. “Harap mereka terus dalam DAP, dalam pilihan raya, kalah atau menang itu biasa. Teruskan mana tahu dalam pemilihan parti akan datang mereka menang.“Namun jika mereka terus dengan keputusan mereka, saya ucapkan terima kasih atas sumbangan mereka,” kata Lim."
