That's the Chicago-to-Louisville flight in which a 69-year-old man was dragged off the plane by airport police officers because he didn't want to give up his seat.United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy says the compensation will equal the cost of passengers' tickets and will come in the form of cash, travel credits or miles.Earlier in the day, United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz told ABC's Good Morning America that the company would never again use law enforcement officers when it decides to to remove passengers from a flight.United personnel had asked for volunteers to give up their seats for four airline employees who were needed in other cities. Three passengers left. Kentucky physician David Dao refused.Munoz said he felt ""ashamed"" of the incident which was video-recorded and went viral. ""This will never happen again on a United flight. That's my premise and that's my promise,"" he said.Munoz offered an apology to Dao, his family and other passengers on the flight. The United CEO had previously referred to Dao as a ""disruptive and belligerent passenger"" in an internal company communication. That reaction was widely panned as exacerbating United's PR nightmare.But when asked by ABC whether the passenger was at fault in any way, Munoz replied, ""No, he can't be. He was a paying passenger sitting on our seat, in our aircraft and no one should be treated that way. Period.""In a statement issued on the airline's website yesterday, Munoz said ""It's never too late to do the right thing.""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/201...assenger-fiasco$1600, laughed. and beat the sh1t out of passenger."

STJQnu72NecThe man who was forcibly dragged off of a United Airlines flight has been identified as David Dao, a doctor, professional poker player and father of five originally from Vietnam who was once convicted of trading drugs for sex as part of a downfall that derailed his medical career.The Louisville Courier-Journal and USA Today confirmed his identity and that he lives in Elizabethtown, Kentucky.Dao, 69, was on his way from O’Hare International Airport in Chicago to Louisville when the incident took place. It was captured on video by nearby passengers and led to outrage and United eventually apologizing for how it all played out.One of Dao’s attorneys, Tom Demetrio, provided an update on his client’s condition at a press conference April 13. He did so alongside one of Dao’s five children, Crystal. He said that Dao suffered a “significant” concussion, a “serious” broken nose and the loss of his two front teeth as a result of the incident.Demetrio added that Dao was discharged from a Chicago hospital April 12 and he will have to undergo reconstructive surgery in order to repair it.Initially, United insinuated that flight 3411 was “overbooked.” However, United spokesman Jonathan Guerin told USA Today that was not the case. He said that all of the 70 seats on the plane were filled, but that didn’t make it over capacity.Instead, a regional affiliate that was operating the flight — Republic Airlines — opted to move four of its passengers because four crew members were considered “must-ride passengers.”Dao is a doctor who studied at a medical school in Saigon, Vietnam. He’s a father of five and a grandfather. Four of his five kids are doctors and his wife, Teresa, is a pediatrician.On April 13, United issued a new statement expressing their concern for Dao and how the incident played out. The company promised to take “immediate action” to fix what’s “broken.”http://heavy.com/news/2017/04/david-dao-un...d-video-photos/"
