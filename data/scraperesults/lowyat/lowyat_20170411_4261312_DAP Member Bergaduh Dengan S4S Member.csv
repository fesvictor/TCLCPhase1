G_KeN,20170411,~~Cheers love <3~~,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,394",200712,,"if all cainis support dap, there wont be a chinese minister in the gov la. most of the pro gov chinese in sarawak especially are old apeks as a lot of them insist that there must be some chinese holding top government positions. in the last sarawakian election, the cainis were promised by the late CM that there would be a chinese deputy chief minister. Thats why DAP lost a couple of major urban seats, but ended up not getting that deputy chief minister post lul."
