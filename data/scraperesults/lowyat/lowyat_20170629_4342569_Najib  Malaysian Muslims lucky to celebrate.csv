Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said Muslims throughout the country are lucky for being able to celebrate the Aidilfitri in a joyous atmosphere and peace with their families, friends and loved ones.The Prime Minister said on the contrary, some people in other Muslim countries could not afford to celebrate the festivity like Malaysians.“They are not as lucky as us, (their) celebrations are quite simple. More sadly, some did not even have the opportunity to celebrate the Aidilfitri...Their lives are at stake, they often face violence and attacks at any time.“Let us continue to pray for our less fortunate Muslim brothers and sisters. May Allah protects and grants them peace,” he said in the latest posting of his blog www.najibrazak.com.Najib also reminded that the favourable circumstances and joyous Aidilfitri celebration in Malaysia were due to the blessings and gift from the Almighty, and that the Muslims should continue to be grateful and protected by Allah. ?

End up one fine day ""bus/ lorry losing control"" kill dozens innocents4) imagine lecturer asking for favors and comparing again other country strict rules (no nonsense , ""kill off"" students future by failing him)..... the student happy to oblige with sex or money end up become incompetent engineers/dentists/doctors prone to corruption somemore (thats how she/he was taught by his mentor/lecturer mah)this is how a country gone to the dogs.... rakyats tidakapa songlap and might do that midly for personal gain, higher ups happy to songlap big time."
