The fire needs to be extinguished completely,"" he said when asked about the emerging challenge from the Semporna MP's party.He said he is confident that the state Barisan and Umno leadership will address the issues raised and convince the people that Barisan is the only party that can safeguard their future.Speaking to reporters after the opening ceremony of the Semporna Al Quran Studies Academy in Bugaya here Sunday, Dr Ahmad Zahid said Barisan's foundation is strong with its track record of listening and delivering the needs of the people.""You don't need to demolish the house if the roof leaks slightly. We just have to fix the roof by delivering the promises made,"" he said, adding that the Barisan pillars would withstand any assault.In advising the people not to make decisions when they were emotional, Dr Ahmad Zahid said opposition parties will always create issues and make all sorts of allegations to confuse the people.""We don't have to be defensive. We must go to the ground and explain to the people what we have done in the state and country,"" he said at the event where some 300 Warisan members rejoined Umno.In his speech, Dr Ahmad Zahid said Sabahans should not make the mistake of changing governments like what happened during the Usno and Berjaya era in the 1970s and 80s.He said under Umno and Barisan, Sabah is undergoing rapid development under a stable government.""I know there is more to be done and we will deliver,"" he added.Dr Ahmad Zahid with Chief Minister Datuk Seri Musa Aman also held a closed-door meeting with Semporna Umno leaders before opening the new Semporna Umno office.Later, he met district police personnel and their families and also attended a Felcra function in Kinabatangan, about 200km from here."
