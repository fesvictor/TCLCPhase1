loui,"  Apr 10 2015, 04:49 PM, updated 5d ago",Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 391,Joined: Mar 2005,From: Seri Kembangan / Kota Bharu,"Details Desciption in How Insurance & Claims Works - Can be Download in PDF FormatI have seen many people posted accident related questions. Will try to compile and help out. Any questions will be answer in the 1st post. Won't guarantee 100% accuracy but I will try to answer as correct as I know. Please tag my name with your question in case I miss outClaim claims guide from insurance companyMSIGMCIS ZurichAm GeneralAllianzEtiqaPacific & OrientAxa AffinAIGTokio MarineBerjaya SompoKurnia/Am GeneralLonpacMPI GeneraliPersatuan Insurans Am MalaysiaQ : What happen when I involve in an accident?A : Don't move your vehicle first, get down, take photo from all angles, make sure all the silent evidences (debris, brake mark, blood stain...) that support your version are clearly taken and most important, vehicle plate number can be easily seen in the photos.Q : What's nextA : Call the police if the accident is serious and wait for police to arrive to scene. If is minor accident, just proceed to the nearest police stationQ : There is a tow truck guy approach me to help out and ask me to sign a letter. Should I allow him to tow & sign the letter?A : Insurance company offered free towing service usually within 40KM distance. Ask tow truck guy nicely(most of them are thugs), whether they are insurance appointed tow truck company. If no, refuse their service and don't sign any document. Call your insurance hotline and ask for a towing service. However some insurance company does cover up to RM200 transportation fees.Q : I am not happy with the way tow truck guy force me into signing the agreement, using them and charged me expensively. What can I do? A : Tow trucks are governed by Automobile Association Malaysia. AAM clearly listed  fix rate in their website. If you dislike the way they conduct their service or price is exorbitant, you may call up and complaint. 
Q : What if both of us decided not to claim insurance, should we still lodge police reportA : On safe side, I still advise you to lodge police report, as you never knew what is on other's mind. They might change their mind and report later and you will be slap with RM300 compound for lodging police report late. Just in case, lodge police report with detail description of the vehicle but left out the vehicle number. For example, ""saya terlanggar sebuah m/kereta no tidak diketahui, jenis Proton Saga berwarna putih"". This is to avoid other hit & run case that happen on the same day to blame on you.Q : What if I give him some money as compensation, can he still claim against my insuranceA : Yes. Hence don't bother to pay any cash compensation as the other party can still claim against your insurance.Q : Should I pay the police compound/saman despite the other side is at faultA : It is up to your discretion. However to challenge a compound/saman, you need to attend to court to explain yourself, which some find it tedious. Many didn't realized that in your insurance policy, insurance company will pay legal costs incurred up to a maximum of RM2,000.00 for defence of any charge including the charge of causing death by driving the Motor Vehicle(other than murder). If your accident has resulted in many casualties and injuries, just rang up or send a letter to the insurance company, they are more then willing to engage lawyer to defence you for free as your compound/saman will greatly affect them if the other parties are claiming. Q : I knock into object (tree, divider, lamp post). Can I claim under OD? Do I need make a police report?A : Normal circumstance, not required. You just send your car to panel workshop, fill up claim form and workshop will proceed from there.Q : What if the object's owner sue me for the damage of the said object?A : You need to lodge police then, forward a copy of notice of claim served to you to your insurance company and let them handle on behalf. You insurance company will pay on your behalf.Q : How to make a claimA : There are mainly 4 types of claim. Own Damage Claim (OD), Own Damage Knock for Knock (OD-KFK), Third Party Property Damage Claim (TPPD) & Third Party Bodily Injury Claim (TPBI). Will not go further since someone did explain further in the other thread Q : How to make an OD(vehicle repair) claim A : You can do it only if you bought comprehensive policy. Sent your car to a panel workshop. You can check from them by demanding appointment letter from the insurance company or just call up the hotline to confirm so. Never send your vehicle to non panel workshop as you will have difficulties to claim and end up incurred cost for transferring to another panel workshop. From there, the workshop will settle it for you.Q :Insurance company refuse to pay my OD claimA : Under insurance policy, insurance company is entitle to deny you claim if 1. drunk2. under drug influence3. involve in illegal activities (ie. rempit) or motor sport competition (ie. rally)4. war, act of terror & riot5. natural cause (ie. flood, earthquake, landslide...)6. no licenseQ : I was told to pay compound for RM400 before they allow my OD claimA : Insurance policy has clause which stated that if the driver is below 21 years old or holding license L/P or is not named in schedule, they will have to pay RM400. Something like saman for allowing incompetent driver to drive the car.Q : What do you mean for allowing driver not named in schedule to driveA : While buying insurance, the policy will have column to put names of people who regularly use the vehicle. Each name cost around RM10. If you did not register the name in the policy, you are deemed to be ""not named in schedule"".Q : I was told that I can't claim against a m/cycle and public transport. Is it true?A : False, you can't claim against m/cycle and public transport through OD-KFK procedure but you can still go ahead to initiate a TPPD claim.
Q : Can I initiate TPPD claim personallyA : Yes. Refer to this sample letter and attached all relevent documents and send it to insured company of third party vehicle. Q : I went on to initiate TPPD claim against the public transport as per your advise but why my claim is rejected?A : First of all, call the claim assessor to find out the reason. In many circumstances, lay man like us will ask the workshop to do for us. Note that workshop staff is also lay man like you. They might proceed to initiate the claim via OD-KFK method instead of TPPD. Insurance company has no right to reject your TPPD claim unless both of you are disputing on the fact of the case. Note that if once you have commence OD claim against your own insurance, you have deem give up the right to claim against another vehicle. Q : Can I claim through OD-KFK if the third party fail to lodge police report. A : Yes. Apart from normal documents like police report and Police Investigation Result(must show third party compounded for traffic offences), you need to sign statutory declaration(SD) to affirm how the accident occurred. SD can be done through commissioner of oath. Q : How do I know whether I am entitle to OD-KFK claim?A : Different insurance companies have different methods but there is a standard requirement for it. 1st, both you and the other vehicles hold comprehensive private car policies. 2nd, police has clearly find the other parties at fault and has compounded him. Just make sure when you send your car to workshop, tell them precisely that you want to do an OD-KFK claim. Workshop staff will guide you through since it is quite common practice.Q : Will I be compensate for the period which my vehicle is in midst of repairingA: You can do it provided you claim through TPPD method. It is term as ""loss of use"". Amount is base on the type of vehicles & engine capacity. Note that period of compensation starts from the day the insurance company's appointed adjuster confirm the damage till the day of the vehicle has been fully repair.
 Q : I am not satisfied with the offer for ""loss of use"". What can I do?A : The amount & duration stated above are merely a guideline from PIAM. Hence it is no legally binding to insured/you. To enable you to claim more, you have to rent a car from a registered car rental company. Only receipt from registered car rental company will be entertain. Or alternatively, if you have file your case in court, get your lawyer to argue for you. Sometimes judge might allowed if you managed to convince him.Q : How to make an injury claimA : You can only make an injury claim against the other vehicle that knock into you. You can either do it personally or get a lawyer to do for you.Q : What is the different between getting a lawyer and do it personallyA : If you get a lawyer to do for you, they will take a cut from your claim. Market rate is around 30%. If you win, they take their cut. If you lose, you don't have to pay anything to them. The good part in getting a lawyer is that they will handle from A to Z  and they will try to get as much as possible since they know roughly how much you can get.Q : How much can I get for my injuryA : In injury claim, 2 things determine the claim amount. The type of injury itself and liability. You can download the compendium for personal awards here. Q : What is liabilityA : Liability simply mean who is wrong/right. In accident case, liability affect the claim. Let's say you are 30% wrong and the other vehicle is 70%. For a claim worth RM10,000, you will get 70% (RM7,000). Hence the more you can proof that the other party is at fault, the more you get. That goes back to the 1st Q&A where taking photos after the accident is essential as to proof that fault is on other side.Q : What if I am totally at faultA : You simply don't get anything if you are at fault however insurance company will offer you ex-gratia (saguhati) offer to avoid dragging the matter and incurred cost engaging lawyer.Q : Do you have sample letter on how to claim personally?A : Sample (required documents are stated in the sample letter)Q : What if the other vehicle don't have insurance?A : You can still claim but against the driver personally. But you will have tough time to get money from him if he is poor. However if the vehicle is belongs to a company, by all means, get a judgement in court and demand him to pay, failing which, wind up his company. As for the unlucky one, government has set up ""MOTOR INSURERS BUREAU MALAYSIA"" to allow victim to get some ex-gratia compensation if the other vehicle does not possess valid insurance coverage. The downside is, they will only pay nominal sum. For example, a RM10,000 claim, they will pay you RM1,000 ~ RM2,000 (depend on your negotiation skill). Still it is better then nothing. Address as below.MOTOR INSURERS BUREAU MALAYSIA						3RD FLOOR, WISMA PIAM									       150 JALAN TUN SAMBANTHAN								    50470 KUALA LUMPUR								        MALAYSIA               Q : Lawyer offer me friendly cash loan, saying that they will deduct from the money I win. Should I take it?A : I would suggest not to unless you are in financial difficulties. Mainly 2 reasons. 1st, they charge registered money lending company@ah long rate interest. 2ndly once you took the money, you will have hard time to change to another lawyer if this one is not doing their job properly. Q : I involved in an accident and has lodge police report. The injured party is filling the claim in court. Do I need to attend court?A : Yes. Police report is useless in court if the maker(you) fail to testify in open court. Most insurance companies have clause in their policy that allows them to ""compound"" you for failing to testify. Whether they would exercised the clause is highly doubtful.Q : I attended the court everytime I was told to. However my case gets postpone many times. This is wasting my time and energy, what should I do?A : Talk to the lawyer in charge, ask them whether it is your turn in the next date. You, as the defendant, are usually listed as the last person to testify after Plaintiff and policeman. Find out whether both of them have testify. You can also tell them that you don't have transport. Insurance company will usually arrange transportation for you and if you are firm enough, you can ask for some token of compensation to attend court. Q : What if I failed to attend court?A : Your police report will not be taken into account and insurance company will lose the case. In this event, insurance company has the right to claim ask you to pay back all the money incurred on ground of non-cooperation. However chances of them exercising the right is subjective.Q : I don't think I am at fault. I want to challenge police compound/summon. What should I do A : How to challenge police compound/summonAdd On Question Q : Do you happen to have a list of recommended insurance companies?A : There are pro and con of each insurance company. Bigger companies have bigger network of workshop, however their claiming process it much slower due to volume. If you are staying outside big city, I suggest you to it from bigger companies.

It's mainly bought for cars that exceed 15 yrs of age. Most don't sell strictly third party anymore. The price would round up to be only slighty cheaper than comprehensive, probably about 5 percentage points difference.For minimum RM12,000 coverage for a 2005 car, P&O quoted (estimate) me about RM530+ for third party + fire + theft, and RM570+ for comprehensive. I suppose these figures are before GST & other charges, after which should come up to about 570+ and 600+ respectively I guess.Was told by ACE that third party can only be bought via Pos M'sia, with the underwriters being UniAsia (now Liberty) and Multipurpose.So I'll be going to Liberty later near Maju Junction and check if I can buy. Will update on the rates.  Oh and can't add on windscreen coverage to third party.Update: Got myself the 3rd party insurance from Liberty at approx. RM310 nett.   Downside is not allowed to purchase windscreen cover."

As usual, i snap some pic and take the driver contact no, then i went to log a police report. As normal procedure, after the report logged, went to meet the Sarjan and describe the happened incident in detail as follow:I was drove at the fastest lane at the highway and there is the emergency stop in front, therefore i need to do emergency brake as well but the car behind me was failed to do so and cause his car was bang behind me, since i manage to hold the brake tight, therefore the car in front of me was safe.Nothing much said from the Sarjan and he just direct me some simple procedure on how to claim the car and so on, then just ask me to follow up with him on the status and come back to collect the report on Monday. Before i left, he also ask me whether i hv the other party contact, and direct me to passed it to him.2 hours later, i have received the call from Sarjen and told me that the other party have also turn up to log a police report. And he told me that the other party was claimed that he is on the fastest lane and i'm the one which cut queue from middle lane to fast lane and cause him to bang my car. Also he told me that he was disappointed with me since i'm not telling the truth, therefore he will not summon the other party.I really disappointed and dunno what shd i do to get back my justice since i was actually the victim but somehow become a offender now.Can anyone advise me on what/how can i do to get back my justice?Appreciate much in advance."

everclear,"  Jul 14 2016, 06:53 AM",Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 56,Joined: Nov 2010,,"Hello, first of all, thank you for the helpful information shared here. I have a few questions below:Yesterday (13 July) evening I was driving my Sister-in-law's car when a guy skided (wet road in rain) and banged me from behind. It was his fault as my car was stationary in a traffic jam pile-up and he just couldn't stop in time.  The guy was of Indian nationality as the ID/license he was carrying were different, he showed me but didn't let me take picture. We both made police report at Sri Petaling Police Station. He even sent me a picture of his police report admitting that he banged me from behind as his brake failed to work. The sergeant there told me to go to Jln Tun HSLee Police Station to collect police report on Friday work hours. And that if I wanted my workshop can also collect for me. I read through the Q & A above but still is quite clueless as to what I should do. My questions are:What should be my next steps?I am thinking of:1) find out my SIL's insurance policy type (now let's assume it's comprehensive)2) should I call the insurance company to report this now or wait for the police report first?3) must I collect the police report during work hours? Can I collect it on Saturday/Sunday? Or night time on weekdays?4) Should I be bothered with checking the other driver's car insurance type (i.e. Comprehensive or third party)? He has been helpful and feeling sorry and even sent me his police report so I think he would tell me if I asked. Would this information be useful?5) If the other driver does not have comprehensive coverage, will the workshop still help me to handle everything (process the 3rd party claim) or do I need to go through more steps or incur more costs than going through OD KFK procedure?6) I am not named under my SIL's car insurance policy. Would this affect the process to claim OD KFK? How long normally does it take for the RM 400 compound (from insurance company) to be refunded? 7) It's a VW still under 5-year warranty so it is preferred to be sent back to the service centre. Do I need to check with my SIL's car insurance company if it's a panel workshop under both scenarios of OD KFK and third party claim?8) I was helping to drive my SIL's car as she resides overseas temporarily. Will this affect anything? Since this is her car, what is the involvement that requires her/her ID's/signature/presence etc?9) Is there any other thing that I missed out or need to watch out for?Many thanks. Really appreciative of the help and support here."

loui,"  Jul 14 2016, 08:41 AM",Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 391,Joined: Mar 2005,From: Seri Kembangan / Kota Bharu,"2. My suggestion is to notify your insurance company in advance (assume you are making OD or OD KFK claim), so that insurance company can respond faster once all documents are complete3. As far as I remember, counter only open at normal working hour. Make sure you buy everything at once, police reports, sketch, investigation outcome and photos.4. Yes only if you are making OD KFk claim5. Most of the workshop does not provide TPPD claim service. But they do have friendly lawyer who regularly service them with fees of course. Ask them and find out the charges of the service before agree on their service6. It won't affect. But you will not get back the 400 you paid.7. You have to. Or else the claim process will be tedious. Just go to their website and find out or just ask the workshop fella.8. Not really. But if you make the claim through TPPD, the settlement agreement require her signature and cheque issued to her name."
loui,"  Jul 14 2016, 09:54 AM",Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 391,Joined: Mar 2005,From: Seri Kembangan / Kota Bharu,"You can't. When it comes to claiming insurance, it is between m/cyclist vs insurance company.Insurance company has sole discretion to decide whether to compensate.And in the event settlement can't be reach and matter goes to court, it is the judge discretion to allow the claim.The successful rate of strike out the claim is less then 10%.And in the process, insurance company need to spend few thousands on legal fees to defend you. So if the injured m/cyclist is willing to settle at nominal amount of few hundred ringgit, insurance company will most likely settle it to avoid incurred more cost.Note that if you want to dispute the claim, the only thing you can do is talk to claim assessor. If the assessor felt that it is worth fighting for, they will get a lawyer to defend you and you need to testify in court. Opponent lawyer will give you tough time, so please prepare for the worst.Even if you did a perfect testimony infront of judges, Malaysian judge is well known of pro plaintiff. Judge will some how find fault on you are found you slightly at fault.Once insurance company is ordered to pay compensation to plaintiff, your NCd is gone forever"

If I was trying to take pictures of the cars and the person I/C and he/she won't allow it, what should I do? should I record a video of the car and the owner?    I afraid that they want to pick a fight if I record video. should I suck it up and let him punch me ? Am I wrong if I fight back?2. If the other person was poor and asking me not to report to police. If they pay money but the amount was not a good amount lol, what should I do?3. If I feel threaten and drive away to the nearest police station, am I wrong? what if I did not take any pictures?4. If I received money as compensation am I wrong if they report to police(Even it's their fault)? if police question, should I say I took it or no?5. So your advice is not to pay money as compensation even the other guy insisted me to pay with cash because the risk is too high?Thanks. sorry for the stupid question"

You are not allowed to snap someone IC. Taking a photo of his car with plate number clearly visible is sufficient. Make sure snap the photo before vehicles are removed and the photos must be taken in the way which police can easily identify who is at fault 2. Up to you. If you don't mind the money, just a take it. If not, lodge police report3. Nope. In fact it is advisable to do so. Malaysia is not that safe. If no pictures taken, just make sure you describe the vehicle you knock into as detail as possible in your police report4. Not sure what you are trying to convey 5.

Find out whether the van is registered under commercial vehicle policy or private car comprehensive policy. There is a link that I put which you can check the vehicle insured under which company. Call up the company and ask.2. If private car comprehensive policy, pressure the police to issue siasatan police. Make sure the van is compounded. Give a copy of the siasatan polis to the workshop and ask them to repair via OD-KFK3. If commercial vehicle policy, pushed for siasatan polis. Claim via TPPD4. If the car infront claim against you, send them a copy of siasatan polis and get them to claim against the van5. You need to take extra effort to push for documents.

For example, explained to the officer that the rider violently knocked on car window with his helmet when car was about to enter roundabout. The officer asked which exit do the car intend to exit. Replied the intended exit to the officer and the officer said the rider knocked on the window because car entered wrong lane into the roundabout. Weird thing is, how would the rider know which exit the car is going to use? Either lane could be right. The car WAS about to entered roundabout not exiting. Clearly the rider motive is intentional but the reason given by the officer sounds like they just want to conclude the case quickly."

I mean how can i assure the real cost of repair ? Can i trust the adjuster ? Can i hire someone to do the job ? Do a double check ? Its not like i dont want that car anymore, but the duration of the repair takes about 3 months and i really need a transportation for work, immediately. If it was declared total loss, atleast i could buy a new car instead. As for right now, any car would be good. I really cant wait that long."

When the bus driver got down, he immediately defend himself and say it was my friend's fault. My friend manage to find witness from car behind and to prove the bus driver wrongdoing. The witness agree to help out my friend. At that point of time, the driver was scare and say sorry whatsoever. Then, they manage to exchange info and promised to file police report later.Then, the thing got worst. When making the police report, the sarjan seems acting funny by pointing such case will end up my friend is at fault, saying it was due to careless driving, and threaten to say nothing can be done even with witness. Later on the bus driver says that he already make the police report went MIA and blocked my friends number. My friend received sms saying that the witness report that is my friend went into the bus lane and bang the bus. At that point of time, the witness havent even go to report the whole incident.After the witness report at police station, my friend thought that there is hope and now we found out that the report has some mistake where the incident date was written 2015 instead of 2017.

At first I didn't know it's damn hard to claim against their insurance, so I had to claim against my own - RM2k worth of damage, so it's worth it to burn my NCD - so when it's my turn to hit a Singaporean registered vehicle, I didn't pay on the spot, and did police report on my own carelessness - RM3K worth of damage...Same thing applies when you visit Singapore - you are not required to get 3rd party insurance, so if you get involved in an accident there, claim against your own insurance as well.Both Singapore and Malaysia should enact a law like Thailand which requires foreign registered vehicles to have at least 3rd party insurance when they drive in their country to protect their citizens..."

Which means you need to prove the other parties is at fault to succeed a claim. Most third party claims usually end up in court due to dispute of facts (both parties stated different versions in police reports) or dispute of amount of compensation (unable to agree on cost of repair) as OD KFK does not apply if involved with foreign vehicles

It is not as easy and straightforward thangetting hit by Malaysian cars, and also may not be worth your time/effort/money to go up and down the court & engage a lawyer. If you get hit by a Malaysian car, just getting the details of the car+driver, the police can follow up to get the accident report out and you claim under OD-KFK or even claim under the 3rd party insurance directly.If you get hit by a foreign registered vehicle, which is covered by a 3rd party foreign insurance provider, you're screwed and you're better off just claiming under OD of your own insurance.

It's actually not that complicated and you don't really need the use of a lawyer. Insurance in Singapore is same like Malaysia in which they are governed by the GIA. They cant just ignore your claim just because you are malaysian and didn't use lawyers. And they also don't like lawyers. They's much rather settle with you direct. All you needed to do was to pay the repairs first, then send a letter of demand to the singapore insurance company with the supporting document and wait. Shouldn't take too long if liability is clearly established. It's too late now since you've already claimed. And your insurance MSIG would probably claim back the cost from the singapore insurance under subrogation. But to test my theory out, you could claim the loss of use and the loss of your NCD (current year) from the singapore insurance. Why not try sending them a letter of demand with supporting documents without lawyer. Trust me, they won';t ignore you"
