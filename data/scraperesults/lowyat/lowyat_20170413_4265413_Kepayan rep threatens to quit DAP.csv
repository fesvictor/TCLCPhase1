If I answer now, I will not have anything to say on Thursday and furthermore the state assembly is still in session,” he had told reporters at the state legislative assembly grounds.Bosi won the Kepayan seat in the 2013 general election with a 7,000-vote majority in a four-cornered contest. However, there have been rumours that he intends to quit DAP although Bosi himself denied any such speculation.This followed claims by a local portal that Bosi would leave DAP and join Parti Cinta Sabah (PCS), which is led by Tamparuli assemblyman Wilfred Bumburing.If he leaves, Bosi will not be the first Sabah DAP leader to quit in less than a year.Likas assemblyman Junz Wong, who was Sabah DAP secretary, resigned from the party on Oct 2 last year and joined Parti Warisan Sabah. Then deputy chairman Joan Goh and vice-chairman George Hiew followed suit.In 2013, Luyang assemblyman Hiew King Chiu left DAP to join MCA.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...icked-for-ge14/"
