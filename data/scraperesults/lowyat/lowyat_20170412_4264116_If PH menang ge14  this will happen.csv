Haven Lunch,20170412,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 5,201509,,"Got good got bad:Good:1. Local news suddenly expose many dark history and scandal. Freedom of press suddenly boom. Any news oso can report, more like entertainment news.2. City landscaping will be prioritized instead of just development. Local government election revived and we can choose our own datuk Bandar.3. Bajet every year will be much cleaner and transparent. Huge cut will be done on ministry of pm and decentralized the budget spending allow state power more authority to develop their state. 4. Much cleaner enforcement, crime rate dropped. Ppl are more calm working around. Streets are much more lively.Bad:1. Expect more massive infrastructure cut than during Abdullah time. HSR might be cancelled and replace with moderate 250kmh speed rail. ECRL might cut too. TRX, Bandar Malaysia and warisan merdeka tower will be halt or cancelled.2. Leftist policy like 4 days working day push up the inflation.3. Tend to make more policy for those businessman who support them. Company can expoit employees even more, with no ot pay and salary increment less than 1%. Soon gardenia cream bun will be our breakfast lunch and dinner.4. Relationship with china and oic turned sour as negotiation of foreign affair doesn't end well. Lost diverse foreign investment and tourism.5. Media become a fool of themselves. More than 50 media broadcast TV license are distributed. Fake news everywhere and anchorman are putting own opinion on news. Political TV show will be mushroomed and a lot of so called ""political expert"" will attend every TV show and talk nonsense.6. Bills tabled and never pass. Different faction of PH fight against each other. Instead of verbal abuse, pull hair, kick punching, throwing pen chair etc. Parliament become wrestling arena.7. Protest held every weekend even small matter. New government has no power against nimbies and feminists.8. More hate crime due to social pressure. Ppl are being judged even slightliest thing.9. Harsh local government and enforcement. No more double parking. Maybe even loitering oso will kena saman."

leonhang,20170412,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 166,200811,,"Bad 7: There's nothing bad about that. Bad 9: How the hell is no double parking a bad thing. Bad 4: OIC can fuck off for all their OH I SEE thing. I doubt relationship with China will turn sour.Bad 3: I am pretty sure you are describing Barsian Najis. PH is mostly a socialist-oriented coalition unlike the kapitalist Barisan Najis. So there's actually 4 good and 4 bad, sounds like a good risk to take"
rayzy22,20170412,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 386,200611,"From: Sri Kembangan, Putrajaya, K.Terengganu, Butterworth",i believe everything mostly will stay the same because we're people with idea but not ready to make it realistic whenever it might cause struggle for a bit while.We got leader what we deserve...because that is what majority of us. Democratic is about majority.
