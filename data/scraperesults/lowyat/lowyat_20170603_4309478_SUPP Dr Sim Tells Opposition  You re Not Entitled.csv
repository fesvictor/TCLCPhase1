automan5891,20170603,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 16,200909,,RM9 million from the state government to service their constituenciesThis is a serious fault in Malaysia gov. 1. Why does MPs require money to service their constituencies? 2. What is it used for? 3. Who will be accounting that it is not misused or embezzled? Frankly all is an excuse to songlap.
