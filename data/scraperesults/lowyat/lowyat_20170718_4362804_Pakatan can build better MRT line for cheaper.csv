Outbackk,20170718,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201707,,"Pakatan can build better MRT line for cheaperSHAH ALAM, July 17— PKR vice-president Nurul Izzah Anwar claimed today that the Opposition pact can build a wider Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network if it were in power, while also keeping its cost much lower.Speaking at a rally tonight, the Lembah Pantai MP said Pakatan Harapan would also be able to provide much better services to the masses.“I want to say thank you for the line between Sungai Buloh and Kajang,"" she said, directing the jest to Prime Minister Najib Razak.“I want to tell Najib Razak. Without wastage, we under Pakatan Harapan with the former deputy prime minister and prime minister can execute the MRT project with a wider network and a lower cost,” she added, to loud cheers from the floor.The RM21 billion MRT Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line stretching 51km was officially opened by Najib today.In conjunction, Communications and Multimedia Minister Datuk Seri Dr Salleh Said Keruak had wrote in his blog that the publicly-funded project was a “gift” from the prime minister to the country."

Nowadays they just keep harping on the same few issues that's proven to have no effect on people outside the urban areas.And they really need to step it up on governing the places that they have won. To show that they can manage things better.PKR and Bersatu are filled with people who cannot cari makan in umno.

nuke13,20170718,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 397,200809,,If want to build in Penang also need fund from the federal government. Opposition led states often very hard to get fund. Look at kelantan with their water problem. Need huge fund from the federal to replace those underground pipes. This is public-funded project after all. Not BN money. Public-funded means the tax money from all people in Malaysia.
