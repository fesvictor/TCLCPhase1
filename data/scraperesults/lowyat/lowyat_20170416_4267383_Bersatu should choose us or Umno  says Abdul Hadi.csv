Any parties that aspires to govern Malaysia, choose PAS or Umno,"" said Abdul Hadi in a full-page interview with Mingguan Malaysia, the Sunday edition of Malay daily Utusan Malaysia.""We are open to any parties that wishes to cooperate with us, on condition that they accept Islam,"" he said.For the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year (full news access)or RM420 a year (full news + full archive access).

UMNO dan PAS adalah bastion pc Malay powerbase.PKR adalah multiracial party yang harapkan sakibaki Melayu dan sebahagian besar minoriti India serta leftovers Cina. Amanah harapkan undi simpati dari penyokong PAS dan Pribumi harapkan undi simpati UMNO.Sejarah membuktikan mana2 pakatan pembangkang yang nak meraih undi Melayu kena berdamping dengan PAS dari Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah kepada Barisan Alternatif dan Pakatan Rakyat. UMNO terpaksa harapkan PAS sebab nak satukan Melayu dan menubuhkan Barisan Nasional bersama Gerakan dan MCA MIC pasca 13 Mei 1969 yang berakhir dengan pembubaran Orde Lama Parti Perikatan.Parti serpihan PAS seperti Hamim, Berjasa pernah lawan PAS dalam dua kali PRU pada 1980an pun terpaksa join coalition PAS termasuk Semangat 46 serpihan UMNO pada 1990. Sama jugak lah bila Keadilan dan DAP harapkan undi Melayu PAS dalam Barisan Alternatif back in 1999. Termasuk PKR dan DAP bersama PAS dalam Pakatan Rakyat pada 2008 dan 2014.Hanya macai2 buta dan bebal politik Melayu will live in denial. Inilah realpolitik."

It's the improvement of shariah yg dibawa PAS.Xada unsur hudud pun sebab xada dinyatakan hukuman mati ke atas penjenayah pun. Cuma nak naikkan hukuman penjara & denda sahaja yg ternyata xsetimpal dgn jenayah.Tp DAP tetap bantah as if ianya hudud.Berdasarkan kajian PKR, majority malays support RUU355 which range around 60-80%. sebab tu last2 Anwar xberani nak katakan xsokong RU355.Tp memberi kebebasan PAS utk bentangkan hudud.Actually RUU355 is good thing but being politised until end of day."

They know who they vote. They know what they want.The points of certain individual use word ""hudud"" is for their own benefits. UMNO use it bcoz want to split PAS-DAP under one roof. Bila nak bentang di parlimen, xada pun UMNo panggil hudud.As long that, PAS-DAP fight; BN will rule no matter we like it or not.If we want good opposition like other country, PAS & DAP supporters should stop blame each other, don't say each party not bring any good, try to sit & respect everyone.When there is no respect, it's hard to discuss."

But my point is you need to open your mind and THINK why the opposition coalition has never been working out so far. You know ""it is madness to keep doing the same thing over and over and expect a different result in the same time"".  The way I see it, maybe ""one on one"" fight is the problem. We need a third block to give the voters more option like what Gagasan sejahtera is doing right now."

Hey, you go look at your own posting track record.Those of us who have been around since the early days know very well why the opposition coalition has not worked as well as planned.  Heck, I have even posted many times the flaws and drawbacks of the opposition coalition.   The propaganda (I see you are still at it) says it is madness to keep doing the same thing over and and over again and expect different results.  But didn't the coalition do well in 2008 and 2013?  2008 they won 4 states, deprived BN a 2/3 majority.  2013 they won the popular vote.  Stop downplaying what the opposition coalition has achieved lah.  All these call for a third block is again propaganda that only helps BN.  Oh, there you go again."
