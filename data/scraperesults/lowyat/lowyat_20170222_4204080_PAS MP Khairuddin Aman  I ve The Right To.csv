I have a right to buy anything I want. I could even buy a lorry or a plane, this is none of their business,"" he told The Star Online.Khairuddin also chided the ""socialist group who liked to pick on the matter.""""I bought the car using legitimate sources, as long as I can still afford it,"" he said.The social media was abuzz recently when a Facebook user, that goes by the name Datin Norhayati Abd Malek, believed to be Khairuddin's wife, posted a photo of a brand new Audi Q7, saying that it was a ""gift"" from her husband.Another posting on her Facebook showed Khairuddin and their children walking on a beach in which she said she is the wife of ""YB Kuala Nerus"".Khairuddin and Norhayati are known to operate a business selling beauty products.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...qdxCpHAk8UTU.99"

squalluz,20170222,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 121,200605,,"The problem is his party advocates living a moderate lifestyle. Even their mursyidul am said he only owns a proton saga to portray that the leaders are walking the talk (even though it was letter proven he owns a Porsche). So this is a violation of the image that the pas leaders are trying to portray. They ask for donations from their supporter during every ceramah, as if the party lacks the funding to keep operating, but their leader buys an Audi Q7 for his wife"

stealthrider,20170223,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 6,201109,,"You know, Prophet Muhammad and his wife Siti Khadijah were merchants themselves. There is also a Hadith that says ""9 out of 10 sumber rezeki comes from doing business. One of the renowned Companions of Prophet, Abdul Rahman Bin Auf was a rich businessman himself. Islam never forbid Muslims from acquiring worldly matters as long as they can balance the afterlife matters as well. Even a verse from the Quran ordering the Muslims to acquire wealth and rezeki after performing Friday prayer. Quite a surprise?"

I thought the late Nik Aziz's lifestyle was pretty in line with what he was preaching.Nothing wrong spending his own money, though. But if he's a leader of a religious party, dialing down on such lavish lifestyle will do some good for the grassroots."
