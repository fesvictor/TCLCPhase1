Jauh lagi... kita kena tunggu lepas pilihan raya ini,"" katanya.Bagaimanapun, ketika ditanya dalam sidang media selepas itu, beliau enggan mengulas lanjut.Ditanya sama ada beliau cukup syarat dan kelayakan, Jamal yakin dengan hasrat berkenaan.""Tiada komen, lebih kurang begitulah,"" katanya lagi, seperti dilaporkan harian itu."
