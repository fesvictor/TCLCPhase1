Coup De Grace,20170615,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,201611,,"The former prime minister claims the government could afford to keep Proton if it had not used tax revenue to buy political support.mahathir-protonPETALING JAYA: Dr Mahathir Mohamad today escalated his bitter row with the government of Prime Minister Najib Razak by alleging the decision to sell Proton was driven by a “blood feud” at the expense of national dignity.“The sale of Proton was forced due to a blood feud. Dignity is of no relevance. Vengeance is more important,” he wrote in his latest blog post.He said the government could afford to keep Proton and did not need to sell it to China-based Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd, if it had not used tax revenue from the people to buy political support.He also questioned the claim that the government had paid RM1.7 billion to Proton.“The RM1.7 billion which was supposed to be given to Proton actually did not reach the company as far as I know,” he said.DRB-Hicom Berhad, the parent company of Proton Holdings, announced on May 24 that it had agreed to sell a 49.9% stake in the national carmaker to Geely, which had earlier taken over Swedish auto company Volvo.Proton, set up in 1983 during Mahathir’s premiership, has been struggling against stiff competition from rival carmakers in recent years, losing market share despite government support.Its market share of 53% in 2001 dropped to 14% last year, amid rising popularity of imports and questions over the quality of Proton’s products.Dr Mahathir said the sale of Proton was an admission that “we have failed and our objective to make Malaysia a developed nation has been thwarted”.He also asked what had happened to the money raised from taxes the government imposed on the people.According to him, the taxes imposed on the people were higher now compared to the heydays of Proton, but the government was still burdened by high debts.“If we scrutinise the profits of businesses in Malaysia today, the tax revenue collected should be higher than during the time when Proton cars were in great demand. Instead, the government’s debts soared.“Where has the government’s money gone? Did it go into this or that pocket?”http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...sale-of-proton/"

All this years you see news famous talking about fatal accident a lot is proton car, recently start to become better but the super songklap problem never bother to solve .... skrg dah nak jual anak baru cakap nak ajar jadi olg baik ..... dah lambat dah ..... and the 100% import tax still will be there even if we don't have any national own car brand, why?

Who instill those ""culture""? You. Who started all the songlaptism in the government? You. Basically, you just destroyed your reputation because of your unhumble rudeness. I just don't know what to say, I'm totally blown away, when mentioning the national dignity, there's a fine line between knowing what is national dignity and your own personal interest.It's just that Dr. M is lucky not to be in an era of social media, if not, you are also gone case too."
tokdukun,20170615,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 259,200611,,"Proton actually made profit during DSZ's time, from pauline tan sos, they even made rm186mil profit in 2010. DrM never liked DSZ, since he came into proton DrM made noise about DSZ. Pretty obvious is because DSZ got rid of DrM's cronies, run it properly, then can make profit. When DRB took over in 2012, it was kinda sudden. I never understood why when proton was steady, Khazanah wanted to give it to DRB. Then DSZ had to ""resign"" (more like macam kena tendang). Lotus CEO Dany Bahar also got the boot due to some dodgy excuses made up by DRB goons. Unlike DSZ, he fought in court for unfair dismissal, end up DRB settled out of court, implying memang DRB salah for sacking Dany. Then proton went down the drain, personnel kept changing, DrM became chairman, QC back to shit again. Lotus supposed to develop an all new model also scrapped when Dany got kicked out. Sorry la, but it's obvious to me DrM is the problem. His cronies not only lower quality, but songlap so much until rm1bil+ losses. It's not like Proton can't be profitable, DSZ proved it can with discipline and good control. DrM masuk je hancur lebur. Dah la tu. For proton's own sake, stay away and ignore everything DrM. Hopefully Geely exert their muscle to discipline back Proton, even if they only own 49%."
