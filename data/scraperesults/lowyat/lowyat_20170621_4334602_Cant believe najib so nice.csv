BeastB,20170621,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 670,201105,,"Wow how stupid are you. Yeah, the fuel subsidy has been removed but that isn't the point now is it? Now we follow crude oil market price....and price has been dropping over the last few weeks, so obviously price in Msia is also dropping every week. But the idiots here like you are saying the recent drop is because of election lah Najib lah Raya lah for f**ks sake grow up. I agree the gov is a corrupt POS but facts are facts, get educated on what's really going on."
LamTin,20170621,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201010,,So i assume you are arguing najib is following the world crude oil price all the while since few years ago? If yes then you are really stupid. If he really following and good majority wont angry the bee end government . Of course subsidy is related as well because we indeed deserve to enjoy a more cheaper fuel all the while. Not let you to songlap billion enjoy and then tax other things to cover. Dude grow up la. everything is inter-related. People wont be angry just because of one thing And people also wont be puji just because of one damn thing.
BeastB,20170621,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 670,201105,,"They have their own formula on how to calculate fuel price based on crude cost and currency exchange. You think they can get away from inconsistent calculation? Maybe they devised the formula to make extra profit from the people - ok, again....NOT the point!My point is only that the fuel price has been decreasing because it SHOULD be decreasing due to global impact. It's not because of elections or raya or whatever bullshit. If the crude price has been increasing these few weeks, you can bet the price here would be increasing as well.Take off your blinders and stick to the point. Yes, we all know gov is corrupt and they are stealing a lot of money from everyone and creating racial wars, bla bla bla - but the point HERE is fuel price in Msia is dependent on crude price. Full stop."
LamTin,20170621,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201010,,What kind of formula? If i not mistaken when crude oil decreasing last time and najib still keep on increasing the price of petrol. Where is the logic? How is the formulae? You saw it? And u still dunno what i meant. People are saying that because they dislike the goverment and hate bijan. So whatever he do also they wont puji him. Get it? So people will create whatever reason to say him regardless wat is the price. Stealing money until whole world also knows how people not angry?
