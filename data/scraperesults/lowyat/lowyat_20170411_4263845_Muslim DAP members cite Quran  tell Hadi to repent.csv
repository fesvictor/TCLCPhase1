Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is (rightly) guided.""The DAP Youth members said they saw no ""wisdom"" or ""goodness"" in Abdul Hadi's remarks.For the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year (full news access)or RM420 a year (full news + full archive access).
