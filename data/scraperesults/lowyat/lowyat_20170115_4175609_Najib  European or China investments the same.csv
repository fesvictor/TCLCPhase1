(We) must go down to the field to meet, shake hands and give attention to every community's problem,"" he said.Najib, in his speech, also admitted that SJKC Pekan was close to his heart due to its uniqueness of having 60 percent Malay pupils followed by Chinese (29 percent), Orang Asli (15 percent) and Indian (four percent).""This makes the school a reflection of the composition of our society,"" he said.At the ceremony, Najib also handed over 'ang pow' to 366 senior citizens and mandarin oranges to the Chinese community which would be celebrating Chinese New Year on Jan 28.- Bernamahttp://m.malaysiakini.com/news/369334#RespekmaiPeeAm"
