Penang party chairman Chow Kon Yeow says 2,576 delegates would begin voting at noon with 66 hopefuls vying for the posts.January 2013:DAP admits to an error in the tabulation of votes during the party election. In the amended results, Zairil Khir Johari, initially in 39th position, is bumped up to 20th – earning the last elected slot in the CEC. Vincent Wu, initially announced in sixth position, drops to 26th place. DAP election director Pooi Weng Keong blames the error on a technical glitch when the results were transferred using Microsoft Excel. Pooi later resigns as election director and Federal Territory DAP committee member over the error.February 2013:The Registrar of Societies (RoS) receives DAP’s report on the results of its CEC election on Feb 8. Director-general Datuk Abdul Rahman Othman says an investigation into the polls is ongoing. Several DAP members file complaints with ROS claiming manipulation in the polls, following an announcement by party leaders three weeks after the polls that there had been a “technical glitch” in the tabulation.April 2013:RoS postpones investigations into the CEC polls until after the 13th general election. Abdul Rahman says DAP has not been deregistered and may still use its symbol for GE13.August 2013:Abdul Rahman says DAP should hold its CEC re-election immediately because this is what the party grassroots wants. He says RoS made the decision based on statements given by the parties involved. DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng announces that the re-election will be held on Sept 29.Sept 29, 2013:While RoS advised that the right platform for the fresh polls is the national congress, the party snubs the advice and goes ahead with the CEC polls at its special congress. The re-election is held at a hotel in Petaling Jaya and the status quo prevails.December 2013:RoS deputy director-general Alias Mamat says the CEC will stay in a “hung” position until the party sends a complete report on its special congress and fresh re-election. Alias says RoS cannot make any decision on the validity of the newly re-elected CEC because DAP has sent an incomplete report. Delegates at the Selangor DAP convention pass a motion to take legal action against RoS, if it continues to refuse to recognise the party’s CEC.September 2014:DAP drops its application for a judicial review of the alleged refusal by RoS to recognise the party’s CEC that was re-elected on Sept 29, 2013. DAP lawyer Gobind Singh Deo says this is because RoS has acknowledged that its statements were just advisory. Senior Federal Counsel Amarjeet Singh, acting for RoS, confirms that its statements in a Dec 6, 2013, letter to Guan Eng were not a legally binding directive.July 2017:RoS directs DAP to hold fresh elections for its CEC following a discussion with Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who is also Home Minister. The issue of the current CEC’s validity was raised earlier by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s press secretary Datuk Seri Tengku Sariffuddin Tengku Ahmad, who insists that the current CEC is not recognised by RoS.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...uPzuTGgOXoh4.99"
