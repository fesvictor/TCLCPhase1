Therefore, they would most likely vote for the status quo, he said.He said the most PH could do is to focus on issues which touch most women’s hearts, which are largely bread-and-butter issues.“Women are the ones who take care of the home.“The issues that concern them are things like the price of vegetables and fish, the increase in price of fuel.“If you want to win them over, you need to campaign on the rising cost of living.”Maszlee also noted that although PPBM had several prominent members, it lacked a woman icon.However, Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) lecturer Professor Azizuddin Mohd Sani, who was also present, disagreed with his counterpart.He said it was the youth who would be the “game changers” in GE14.“The fence-sitters are the youths. If you want to win, then you need to get the youth to vote for you.”He also claimed that BN had done a better job at this than PH.“BN knows that it needs to get the support of the youth and that’s why they came up with the 2050 National Transformation Plan (TN50).“I still don’t see PH showing any signs that they are targeting the youth.”"
