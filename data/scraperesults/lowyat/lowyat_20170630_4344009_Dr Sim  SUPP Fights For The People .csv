The Kuala Lumpur City Council (DBKL) has demolished flats to rebuild new ones, which is very good. This is what SUPP wants for the people, not just simply renovating the flats,” he said at SUPP Kuching Branch’s 58th anniversary celebration last night.“We come from the grassroots and we will continue to fight for Sarawakians and Sarawak’s future.”Dr Sim, who is Local Government and Housing Minister, also reminded party members to continue to be with the people and for the people.Meanwhile, event organising chairperson Vicky Lim said SUPP Kuching Branch is the oldest branch in Sarawak and called on members not to forget past leaders who have served and dedicated themselves to the party.She said despite the setbacks in past elections, the party understood that it still has a role to play in the government.“We continue to do the best to be the bridge between the people and the government. Our Youth and Women wings have been active in community work. In this respect, focus has been placed to help the needy get the aid they need.“To get to the heart of the people, we must help them get what they really want. Strength comes from the people, who are the grassroots,” she said.At the same time, Lim reminded members on the objective of the formation of the party, and that Kuching Branch is very fortunate to have a great team behind it.Among the activities organised to mark the two-day celebration, which ends today, include a SUPP History Exhibition, local food fair, karaoke competition, and a street dance performance.Also present during the event was SUPP Kuching Branch chairperson Datuk Lily Yong.http://www.theborneopost.com/2017/06/30/su...ticises-dr-sim/"

The signatures we collect will give a mandate for our chief minister to represent the voices of our rakyat to the federal government to say more action has to be taken because our people are suffering.

Outside, you say you’re against it, but your MP in Parliament voted for it, supported it. This is what we call political cheat.”"
