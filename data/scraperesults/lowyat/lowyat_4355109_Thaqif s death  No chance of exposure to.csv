The reading was normal and nothing out of the ordinary,"" he said in a press conference at the school.Afdhaluddin said Thaqif was not having any other health issues until the day he left the school upon abruptly quitting his studies at the tahfiz centre on March 31.""As far our records show, Thaqif was in the best of health when he was studying here and when we returned him back to his family on his last day here,"" he said.None of the other students and staff members had been reported of falling sick due to leptospirosis, according to Afdhaluddin.""As the case is still on-going, we will still extend our co-operation with the police or the state health department should the centre need to be inspected,"" he said.Afdhaluddin also added that the medical report which concluded Thaqif's death was due to rat urine infection had given the opportunity for the centre to clear its name from the numerous allegations it faced in past."
