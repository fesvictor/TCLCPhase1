dangerminimouse,20170419,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 95,201609,,"Zairil says new intimate pictures are ‘fake’GEORGE TOWN, April 19 — Bukit Bendera MP Zairil Khir Johari today denied he is the man shown hugging a woman resembling a DAP youth leader, after such pictures emerged online yesterday. This is the first time he is directly addressing the matter, having previously declined comment about the emergence of another set of photographs and a video of the two dancing. “No, it’s not me. It is clearly another attempt to malign me with personal attacks. They are fake, and that’s all I have to say,” he said in a message to Malay Mail Online today.“Clearly, some conductor behind the orchestra,” he added.Yesterday, DAP Socialist Youth executive committee member Dyana Sofya Mohd Daud similarly rejected the photographs as a politically-motivated attack. She also said she would not entertain such attacks. The latest pictures are arguably the most distinct of the three releases. In the newest set, the man and woman are shown sitting closely at a restaurant in one photograph. Another shows him holding her affectionately and yet another depicts the two kissing.The final photograph shows the woman drinking from what appears to be a wine glass"

When people like this in power, i'm sure there will be someone willing to exploit this bad trait, n then he will be blackmail to become songlap geng too later...    you see even though he might have high integrity value, but if he cannot embrace his moral value publicly. he will be exposed to manipulation by other due to this weakness... so my vote will never go to people like this."

When they have less power to abuse, the amount and scale of corruption also reduces.It's unlikely to completely remove corruption, but by removing them from power, we can reduce the amount and scale of corruption.Doing this will also improve BN as a party since they will be less corrupted, and they will have to be less corrupted if they want to remain in power.The more power you have, the bigger the scale of corruption. For example, a low ranking less powerful gov official can maybe have a few million at most in corruption but a high ranking more powerful one may be able to pull of 100s of millions if not billions in corruption. Even if you can't remove that corruption completely, you want to reduce the scale as much as possible so instead of 100s of millions, it's only few hundred thousand, which is a huge difference."

Bukan pukul rata. Ramai Cina yang tidak ada masalah dengan Islam dan PAS,"" kata pengerusi Lujnah Perpaduan Nasional PAS Selangor itu.PAS dan Umno kini melakukan serangan terhadap DAP dengan melabelkan parti itu sebagai anti Islam dan Melayu.Dengan tindakan itu, mereka berharap akan merosakkan imej rakan dalam Pakatan Harapan (PH) yang memenangi undi popular pada pilihan raya umum lalu.Umno berharap mereka boleh memberikan persepsi di kalangan pengundi Melayu yang empat parti dalam PH sedang dipimpin DAP dan menakutkan orang Melayu, negara bakal dikuasai Cina jika ia menang pilihan raya umum nanti.Pemimpin Umno termasuk Ketua Wanita Shahrizat Abdul Jalil memberikan amaran kepada pengundi Melayu yang pemimpin DAP, Lim Kit Siang akan menjadi perdana menteri jika PH berjaya menawan Putrajaya.PAS turut meningkatkan kempennya terhadap DAP, walaupun pernah bekerjasama dalam dua pilihan raya lalu, selepas DAP dilihat cuba menentang pindaan undang-undang syariah.Kempen ini semakin menjadi-jadi selepas usul RUU355 dibentangkan Presiden PAS Abdul Hadi Awang di Dewan Rakyat.Apabila akhbar Nanyang Siang Pau menyiarkan karikatur mengenai usul RUU355 di Dewan Rakyat dengan menggambarkan Hadi dan Speaker Dewan Rakyat Pandikar Amin Mulia sebagai monyet di atas pokok berdepan “ubi panas”, ia juga dikaitkan dengan DAP.Hakikatnya, Nanyang tiada kaitan dengan DAP tetapi dimiliki ahli perniagaan dari Sarawak yang menyokong SUPP, parti kerabat dalam Barisan Nasional.Nanyang kemudiannya memohon maaf dan menarik balik kartun ini.Hadi ketika berucap di Marang pada majlis sambutan selepas kejayaan membentangkan usul meminda RUU355 menyerang DAP habis-habisan dalam ucapan itu.""Dulu Singapura dalam Malaysia, ada cawangan PAP di Malaysia. Bila Singapura keluar daripada Malaysia, PAP tukar jadi DAP.""Jadi, DAP ini anak butir tahi PAP. (Saya) Sebut dengan bahasa yang kasar sedikit,"" katanya pada10 April lalu.Penyelidik, Mohamad Hisomuddin Bakar berkata kempen sentimen ini boleh berkesan untuk pengundi luar bandar yang tidak mempunyai akses kepada maklumat lengkap.""Pengundi bandar yang terdedah kepada segala maklumat akan lebih faham ia bermotif politik dan cuba menutup apa masalah sebenar mereka,” katanya.Bagi Normah, suri rumah itu, bahan kempen anti DAP yang masuk ke telefon bimbitnya melampau dan tanpa ragu-ragu terus memadamkannya.""Apa semua ini? Ingat orang bodohkah?"" katanya. – 20 April, 2017."

silic0sis,20170420,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,200508,,"Those are completely legit points, but then you have a government who incites racial hatred, who control the masses (read: rural folk)  through (mis)education, false media and propoganda, who incite hatred against those who do not agree with their religious beliefs (and in turn enables and creates more radicals). Those things are also backward and also affect us economically. As I'm sure you understand, the NEP itself is the bane of malays, it hinders malay growth and if malays don't grow economically, it's very unlikely malaysia will succeed economically in the long term. As the minority shrink and majority multiply, it becomes more and more difficult for the minority to support the majority. This fact is also a huge reason for the brain drain. The situation is similar to Brexit in some sense, where they had to decide whether to relinquish control of their borders and therefore potentially lose much control over the well-fare of their citizens (due to possible large influx of refugees with very different ideology), a potentially permenantly damaging situation, but retain current financial situation or take the hit financially in the short term and avoid potential future ideology clashes and solve financial situation after. We have a similar decision to make here in Malaysia as well, do you take the short-term economic hit and try to repair social aspects and well-being of the country or do you maintain the downward course?Edit: regarding corruption, I'm not too fussed about some slight corruption. It's unlikely that we can totally eliminate corruption plus corruption is what makes it so easy to do business in malaysia. Instead of endless red tape, we can just pay off some people to get things approved. Corruption affects the poor the most but they don't seem to care anyway. There has to be some control though, right now it's so insane, even gov officials at the bottom are asking for ridiculous amounts of money."
