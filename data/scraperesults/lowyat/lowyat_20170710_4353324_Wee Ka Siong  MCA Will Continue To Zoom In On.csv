Lim said if government officials or politicians were under investigation, they should resign or be suspended, but when he was being investigated and charged in court, his earlier remarks were forgotten. This shows inconsistency,” he added.Highlighting another example of Lim’s inconsistency, Dr Wee said that the Chief Minister said in Parliament in 2008 that direct negotiation for projects, instead of open tender, could be construed as an element of corruption.“However, when he awarded a Penang state government project to a company via direct negotiation, he said it was a game changer.“If the Federal Government did so, he would go all out to criticise and accuse us of cronyism,” he added.Dr Wee added that Lim has to address all the questions that have been raised, including the “absurd amount” given as consultation fees for projects in Penang.“Why doesn’t he explain the reason for the RM305mil spent on feasibility studies for four projects in the state, and why would they settle the payment of some RM200mil when the report is not even out yet?” he questioned.Dr Wee said that the consultation fees took up 30% of the entire project’s cost, which he said was ridiculously high.Developers usually keep it within 5% to 7%, he added.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...udJiilVvuZp4.99"
