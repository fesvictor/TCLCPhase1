danielmckey,20170713,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 367,200801,,Why BN keep calling people asking 1. whether satisfied with current Selangor Gomen? 2. Still support with the Federal Gomen? 3. Change from Pakatan Gomen to BN?What is this survey mind game?

radical85,20170713,lalala~~,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 623,200510,,"/seriousI think so too. By now i think those opposition supporters will be like me kinda give up on ""changing"" the nation. It's quite clear to me that the government will never change and BN is ready to die together with the nation if they were to lose. Or maybe because i grow older i began to be able to appreciate my parent's (BN voter) opinion. They said this country belongs to ""them"" la, it's no use complaining or even try to change because the majority of the Malaysian DOES NOT WANT the change. Changing the government is not like changing ur cloths, it requires unity and a lot of hardship which is impossible for the majority of malaysian to endure. It's not that we can't/don't want to change, we couldn't!!The election back in 2012 is the last and final chance"

radical85,20170713,lalala~~,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 623,200510,,"So true. My hope crumbled kaw kaw when they started infighting. Haven't even win the war they started to bite among themselves for a piece of pie that they havent even gotten yet. What a jokeThey say so loud wanna abolish the double standard system, wanna promote free market but then when giving public speech time they spew the same racist bullcrap like how ppl should vote them la, he/she will protect <insert race> la.I started giving up when even LGE say GST is bad for the country. Come on la, stay strong with ur fucking agenda. DONT KEEP SAYING STUFF that u think the rakyat likes to hear. DO WHAT IS BEST FOR THE COUNTRY and not do-what u-can-to-win-election. If u are behaving like BN i might as well vote BN and skip the tormenting government change period. Sohai opposition"
