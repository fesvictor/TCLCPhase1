The population of 850,000 require houses and employment.“The priority is to preserve the forest and greenery,” Dr Tan further wrote.In 2014, DAP’s Tanjung Bungah assemblyman Teh Yee Cheu alleged that illegal hill clearing was taking place in Bukit Kukus.Dr Lau urged Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng and the Penang government to explain the alleged extensive land clearing activities.“People say that Gerakan is making a political attack against the DAP, what with an impending general election and the fact that we are the Opposition in Penang.“But this is not about politics. These are facts.“They (DAP) said before that they wanted to protect the environment, but they did not keep to their promise,” he said.Dr Lau also claimed that foreign direct investments (FDIs) in Penang dropped drastically between 2010 and 2013.“FDIs fell 82% in Penang during that time, according to the Malaysian Investment Development Authority.“Also, since 2015, several factories and companies based in Penang island have moved out, seeking other places for business,” he said.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...07mqqSJzeTfK.99"
