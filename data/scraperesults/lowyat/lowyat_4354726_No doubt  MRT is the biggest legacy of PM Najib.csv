I think I saw some MRT documentary before, there's a lot more tunneling knowledge transferred locally compared to when MMC-Gamuda did SMART tunnel, there's even an academy established.In the future perhaps, tunneling skills may be needed locally, or around ASEAN region, and we can be the hub for others to consult to.Kudos to that. That is some genuine skill development, job creation and value added to our high skilled sector."
