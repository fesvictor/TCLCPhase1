kevinwawa,20170329,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 114,201105,,"PUTRAJAYA: Selangor Umno liaison committee chief Tan Sri Noh Omar today questioned why the opposition and several ex-Umno leaders are making a fuss over the proposed move to amend the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1965, also known as RUU355.He questioned the silence from the opposition camp when RUU355 was amended in the 1980s.""""Why now? It is not new? Why didn't DAP protest when RUU355 was tabled to be amended in the 1980s?""It is merely politics. Please stop politicising the matter. This is an issue related to the Muslims and let the Muslims settle it"".Malaysian Islamic Strategic Research Institute (Iksim) had previously said that the move to amend RUU355, by empowering the Syariah courts to mete out tougher penalties, was to uphold the wellbeing of the 'ummah'.Iksim said the proposed amendment should be perceived as a deterrent for Muslims to commit any wrongdoings.The RUU355 polemics taken up by certain quarters had given the impression that there were efforts to make sure Muslims would continue to transgress against the values of Islam that seemed to benefit those in the ""sin"" industry.Malaysian Muslim Consumers Association (PPIM) media adviser Tuan Asmawi Tuan Umar was quoted as saying that some Muslims had even belittled the small amount of fine they had to pay for khalwat (close proximity) offence."

Faidzal,20170329,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 234,200808,From: From JB to KL!,bcos during previous amendments:1. it was not to increase the amount of punishment until it became closer to hudud like what hadi is supposedly proposing.2. it was amended to include sabah and Sarawak (sabah and Sarawak was not affected by RUU355 until 1989 amendment) which surprisingly the sabah/Sarawak BN ppl also didn't object.3. the last amendment done during the time most opposition ppl including DAP top guns like LKS and karpal etc. were under ISA (ops lalang) so how can they protest when they are incarcerated unfairly without trial?

Faidzal,20170329,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 234,200808,From: From JB to KL!,amendments are fine if its:1. well written and well debated (something hadi has avoided 2 times since his last tabling)2. has avenue for recourse such as false accusation (something current law does not have)3. independent body to monitor enforcement since it seems penguatkuasa agama is somewhat above the law (case like the borders bookstore manager being wrongly accused of selling a banned book when it was not banned yet when she was arrested and that married couple being falsely accused of khalwat)

ray123,20170329,Senior Citizen,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 2,450",200301,,"This is inevitable. Many of the minorities in Malaysia understand that discussions related to religious tolerance can only be decided by the Muslims in reality.The question is, are the Muslims implementing such laws because they really want it, or because they fear they will be singled out and targeted if they speak against it?I'm not sure Malaysians in general have any sense of individualism, we're quite docile like a herd of sheep and would do things to conform with the consensus rather than to speak our minds. People in positions of power demand certain things and because we're taught to obey the authority, we bow our heads without question."
