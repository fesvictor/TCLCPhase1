The No. 1 and No. 2 will be starting their nationwide pre-election blitz very soon.Hishammuddin will be taking over foreign travels that the top two are unable to do so.The Opposition parties wasted no time in spinning the appointment as a move to checkmate Dr Ahmad Zahid.But a political insider said this is not about making Hishammuddin the “DPM 2”.“The power line-up is still Najib as No. 1 and Zahid as No. 2. But I guess the appointment means that Hisham is now No. 3 in the Umno hierarchy,” said the insider.Both Dr Ahmad Zahid and Hishammuddin are Umno vice-presidents but the former has assumed the duties of the deputy president following the sacking of Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.That has left Hishammuddin as the only vice-president. But the appointment puts him in a firm position as the top vice-president.“It is a clear signal that the PM wants the best senior leadership team to face the challenges ahead, especially with the general election looming.“Seniority is important in politics and this is a way to establish a clearer hierarchy within the national leadership,” said KRA political risk analyst Amir Fareed Rahim.Najib is sitting very strong in Umno especially after the Umno general assembly last December. The chain of command is clearly established after more than a year of intense power struggle.On top of that, he has Dr Ahmad Zahid, his long-time friend and political comrade on his right and cousin Hishammuddin on the left.Dr Ahmad Zahid is bound to feel a little nervous over Hishammuddin’s upward move but his insurance is that Najib is too astute to put his cousin as the No. 2.Two cousins at the top would not be well-accepted by Umno or Malaysians. It would be too much to swallow and it would open the party to all sorts of insinuations and gossip.“There will be all kinds of conclusions drawn about what has happened but it very much means that the PM has redrawn his inner circle,” said Amir.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnis...vYbS5YUgi0X6.99"
