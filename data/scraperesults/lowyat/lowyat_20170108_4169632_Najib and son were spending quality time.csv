JeremyLord,20170108,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 218,201211,From: Planet Earth,"Photos uploaded by the prime minister’s son Norashman Najib may have sparked speculations that the family may be using a government jet for their holiday but Rizal Mansor, aide to Norashman’s mother Rosmah Mansor, sees things differently.Rizal shared Norashman’s Instagram photo when he was cycling with his father Najib Abdul Razak, which he noted had caused a fuss on the Internet but gave a different perspective.“Like other people, they want to do activities together, more so because they are very close.“But constraints due to the father’s duties meant that it was impossible for such activities on a regular basis.“They can only spend time together when the father is on holiday,” he said.Rizal said Najib had to work late seven days a week and could only have around 10 days with his family as he is occupied for the other 355 days.“I stared at this photograph for a long time and I could see the satisfaction on their faces that they could spend time together,” he said.Rizal said this was something to reflect upon that people have different fortunes, with some having a father who can spend time or money on them while others do not have a father at all.Rizal also subtly compared the humble activity to that of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) president Muhyiddin Yassin and Bersatu chairperson Dr Mahathir Mohamad.“They could have skied in Europe or rode on horses at their family ranch in Argentina, but that would be their respective choices,” he said.Rizal appeared to be referring to Muhyiddin’s Europe trip with his family, photos of which his children shared on Instagram.Mahathir’s opponents have also repeatedly accused him of owning a ranch in Argentina.Norashman’s photos on Instagram generated controversy as the locations in Australia appeared to coincide with the destination of the Malaysian government Airbus Corporate Jet 319 with registration number 9M-NAA.The tracking of the aircraft on flightaware.com was removed at the request of the aircraft operator after the Australian trip was highlighted by Malaysiakini.Read more: https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/368500#ixzz4VAsGbyM5"
