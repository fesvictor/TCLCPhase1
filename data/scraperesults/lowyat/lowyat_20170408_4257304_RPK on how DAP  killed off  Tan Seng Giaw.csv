File pix by Yazit RazaliKUALA LUMPUR: DAP pulled off “the biggest fraud in Malaysian political history” over four years ago, to ‘kill off’ party vice-chairman Dr Tan Seng Giaw and ensure the survival of the political dynasty of party supremo Lim Kit Siang and his son Guan Eng.This was the bold claim made by blogger Raja Petra Kamaruddin, via a posting on the Malaysia Today website yesterday.Raja Petra, in his posting, provided an inside story into what went down in the DAP’s party election in 2012 and the subsequent party re-election, which he claimed was “rigged even more”.The fiasco, according to Raja Petra, began in the December 15, 2012 party election, which was attended by 2,576 delegates from 865 branches.However, he noted that about 1,300 delegates did not receive their notice to the meeting, while 547 “illegal delegates” (not eligible to attend the meeting) attended.“The voting was then held with the presence of the 547 illegal delegates and the absence of 1,300 eligible delegates, now barred from voting.“After a more than three-hour delay, the results were announced and at 8.30pm, the 20 winners to the Central Executive Committee (CEC) held their first meeting to elect the party’s office bearers,” he said.Raja Petra, however, noted that two weeks later, “due to a lot of pressure”, DAP announced they had made a mistake, and that it was Zairil Khir Johari, and not Vincent Wu Him Ven, who was one of the 20 winners.“The truth is they suddenly realised they had no Malay face so they dropped Wu and replaced him with Zairil to give DAP at least one Malay face,” he claimed.Subsequently, Raja Petra noted that while the DAP was supposed to have held a second CEC meeting, with Zairil in the lineup, with whatever decisions made by the “original” CEC now null and void, it did not.“They accepted the decisions of this first incorrect or illegal CEC meeting without holding a second CEC meeting comprising the correct CEC members,” he said.Following a complaint with the Registrar of Societies (RoS), DAP was ordered to hold a second election (a reelection) and it was held on Sept 29, 2013.It saw the same number of delegates attending the meeting, but with an increase of 120 branches, which he claimed was not possible as the CEC was illegal and not authorised to approve new branches.He noted that the re-election should have also been based on the attendance of 1,300 delegates who were initially barred from the earlier meeting, and minus the illegal delegates, which would roughly amount to more than 3,300 delegates.He explained that had they done so, Tan would have won the top slot, while Kit Siang would have been in the bottom 10, and Guan Eng not even in the top 20.“In short, in the Sept 29, 2013 re-election of the 16th Party Congress, DAP repeated the error or discrepancy of the December 15, 2012 election.“To make it worse, they made more errors by increasing the number of branches by 120 (which were not approved) and yet the 2,576 delegates mysteriously remained the same,” he claimed.Following a second complaint with the RoS, he said the DAP ignored the body’s instructions to hold a third election, and claimed that if they had done so, it would have meant an admission that the earlier elections were fraudulent.“Secondly, if they were to follow the correct delegates list, then Tan Seng Giaw is in and Kit Siang and Guan Eng are dead meat.“The RoS, until today, has not accepted and recognised DAP’s December 15, 2012 party election and the September 29, 2013 party reelection.“DAP has to rectify this with a party re-reelection, which they have not. That means DAP is an illegal organisation and can get de-registered any time. The knife is now in the hands of the RoS and that knife is currently at DAP’s throat. And DAP’s stupidity and arrogance is what caused this,” he added.http://www.nst.com.my/news/2017/04/228189/...d-tan-seng-giaw"
