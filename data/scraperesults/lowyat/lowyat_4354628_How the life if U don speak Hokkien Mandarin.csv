Whoever doesn't understand sit like bodoh lo.Yes it's a barricade, because not only you don't understand three quarter of the meeting, you can no longer control what your subordinates speak to your client cause you can't understand what they're saying. Best part is sometimes they have the cheek to directly talk to you in Hokkien and then they ask ""do you understand?"" in which the whole meeting room will laugh.The first time I left after 9 months, go back KL.Been working in KL for 4 years now suddenly kena trasnfer back to island again, planning to leave soon cause fed up of being in the dark.Kanneh."

Patent copyrights are for the sick man. Its just like ap right of the naza group. If they dont have the ap advantage, they wouldnt have be that rich and successful .In asia, they dont depend on patent. Patent are like tongkat that prevents competitors from competing with you. Even they dont have the patent and technology, they can still make their own version and sell their products to the world and make it to the top. That is the definition of great and properous business  and culture which they can be proud off.The west has more patents because they were earlier than others in industrial revolution whereas in other parts of the world particular asia , putting food  on the table was more important. At that time , asia just came out from the civil wars. Now that asia is on par with the west, they are nobody . They are just like jaguh kampung. They were great at that time because they were the early birds in the tech world but today they are slow learners, they  are playing catching game with asia  lol.Asia are not not like those kaki putar in india. They keep telling how good they are but after  years of bullshiting, they still cant make their share of tech industry. India produces great ceo who can talk crap while putar belit. Ang mo loves them to talk alot to make people happy because they can turn a lousy product into top end products with their mouth but when it comes to producing good products , they lack the capabilities.Asia has all . The ability to create from nothing , produce it and make it to the world make them a level higher than everyone."

APs is once again, a different thing entirely. Please don't pull a redbean on me.If you had an idea, but someone else copied your idea, how'd you feel? Don't give me the BS reply that it's competition. Make your own version which doesn't adhere to international standards that have already been set by international engineering committees? Good luck with that.Unfortunately we are still playing catch up with the West because your term ""great and prosperous business/culture"" is more like cut-throat unethical practices that do harm to the economy, widening the gap between rich and poor.India is a part of Asia, can you please go back to your geography as I believe you've been putar-belit-ed by red bean team. FYI, India has multiple R&D and Tech parks, you're just not aware cause it doesn't pop up in the news. They are one of the leaders in waste water treatment, Intel is setting up a R&D centre there, their industries have purchased over many western companies in an attempt to buy over their patents and learn from them too.If you believe that ang moh/indian product is low end, why bother buying and/or using microsoft products, google products, LV, Gucci etc etc.? Where is the Chinese replacement of the x86 architecture, the OS?Don't forget, even Xiaomi phones have to use Broadcom/Motorola/Intel/Nokia tech to make it work. Bodo."
