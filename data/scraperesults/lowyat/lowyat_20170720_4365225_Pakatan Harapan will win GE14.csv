The validity of his survey, Did he really carry out the survey ?3. Results biases - He would have meddled with the actual survey results and removed all that have supported BN and reduce their answers, thus increasing the number of his teams results.4. Everyone remembers what CNNs poll of Trump was ? They said he was loosing badly to Clinton. But at the end of the day, Trump wonHence, Rafizi's results are FAKE NEWS"
