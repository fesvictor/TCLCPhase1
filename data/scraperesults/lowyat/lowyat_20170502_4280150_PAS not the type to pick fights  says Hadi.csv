They were the ones who kicked us out. We didn’t leave.“Semangat 46 left our pact in 2000. It was DAP which left Barisan Alternatif.”In Pakatan Rakyat, Hadi said it was DAP which proclaimed the death of the pact without following any “rules”.“We didn’t leave Pakatan Rakyat.”PAS and DAP’s first “relationship” ended in 2000 when they were in Barisan Alternatif, and the reunion after the 2008 general election in Pakatan Rakyat ended in 2015.When asked about the possibility of three-cornered fights in the next general election, Hadi said PAS was not afraid of such contests.“We’ve faced all scenarios in politics because we’ve been in politics a long time.“We’ve been alone, we’ve been left with one seat and we’ve also had no seats; straight fights, three-cornered fights, we have had a lot of experience.”What was important, Hadi said, was that PAS members and divisions stayed loyal to the party leadership.Yesterday, the PAS muktamar passed a motion to cut ties with PKR, subject to a decision by the PAS Syura Council, the party’s highest decision-making body.This year’s muktamar was the second party assembly since the 2015 party elections which saw the defeat of several veteran leaders who were contesting for top posts.These leaders later set up Amanah, which is now part of Pakatan Harapan together with PKR, DAP and Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia."
