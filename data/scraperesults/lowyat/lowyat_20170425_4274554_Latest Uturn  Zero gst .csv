I am actually ok with GST.  There I said it.  But then I see the poor and those who are really struggling.  They are the ones who are most affected by GST.  The GST had such a huge multiplier effect that even with BR1M it can't cover the higher cost of living.  For the middle class, which I think most of us belong to, it isn't that bad.  We can afford the price hikes.  We just cut down on other things.  But do spare a thought for the poorer folks, there is nothing for them to cut back on.  I think when GST was about to be implemented, the 'high' rate of 6% was one of the complaints.  We could have started slower, like 3%.  It could have cushioned the blow."

joe_mamak,20170426,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,0% GST means no need to pay.  But the GST system remain in place.  Business operators do not need to spend more.  Just from 6% becomes 0%.

joe_mamak,20170426,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,I don't know who didn't get the memo.  Or which is the right memo.  The statement from Nurul seems to be the right one now.  https://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?showtopic=4274901&hl=

joe_mamak,20170426,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"No lah.  They have said it would be done away with before.  Go look at the NST article.  They list it out. https://sg.news.yahoo.com/pakatan-now-says-...-154110692.htmlI wonder did she really say won't abolish GST or said will not continue with the current ""high"" percentage."

lepo,20170427,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 330,200607,,"So, does they actually discuss about gst joe? Who has the final word in PH?"
joe_mamak,20170427,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Let me summarize what I found reading various news - 1. PKR, DAP and Amanah have all said they would do away with GST.  Person who said this in PKR was Wan Azizah.  The video I posted, also shows Nurul rooting to do away with GST.  In DAP, Lim Guan Eng said no GST, no toll if PH comes into power as the Federal government.Amanah, they participated in the Himpunan Mansuh GST.There was consensus that PKR, DAP and Amanah will do away with GST.  Since you are a PAS supporter, one of the PAS leaders also said GST is haram.  But Hadi a few months later said it was a good mechanism.   2. A few days ago, at the Bersatu gathering Nurul Izzah said AlsoYou interpret that for yourself as to what it all means.  The headline by NST is ""Pakatan now says it won't abolish GST if it wins GE14"".  BN supporters and blogs are now echoing the same thing.  Najib also has come out to say something.  3. Others in the forum have explained that GST cost so much to implement (in the millions to companies and also customs).  To do away with GST would also cost money.  So, by having everything zero rated I guess it won't cost that much.  But what is the net effect of having zero rated GST?  Government doesn't get to collect this tax.  Companies don't incur input tax.  They don't collect GST either (on behalf of the government).  Consumers don't have to pay the 6% GST.  To me, as a consumer it seems the net effect is the same, zero GST or no GST.You go interpret for yourself what that means.  4.Did they discuss all this?  What Nurul said indicates that they did.    Lim Guan Eng has also come out to clarify and said the same thing zero percent GST.   He insist that zero percent GST is effectively the same as doing away with GST.  See - http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...-abolishing-gstRead it in its entirety.  The reason for doing so is in the article. Seems DAP and PKR are on the same page. 5. No need to play up who has the final word on this.  As it is, it seems there is consensus.  We can wait for Amanah to come out with their own statement.  You want to play it up that Amanah has to follow DAP and PKR, be my guest.   6. But zero percent GST does seem to be the same as doing away with GST.  Already said before, what's important is no need to pay."
