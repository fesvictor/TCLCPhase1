He counter-challenged Nazri to do battle in Langkawi where Mahathir is the party’s new division chief.The exchange culminated in a Mahathir aide telling FMT on March 10 that Mahathir has confirmed his keenness to debate with Nazri on certain key issues.A PPBM team is already making the necessary arrangements for the debate to be held in Padang Rengas during Mahathir’s visit, the aide said.“Details of these arrangements will be submitted to Nazri’s office soon for confirmation. Dr Mahathir is looking forward to the debate,” the aide said.Referring to the FMT report quoting the aide, Norden said the date for the debate has not been confirmed, but noted that Mahathir is expected to be in Padang Rengas to attend an event on March 25.He said Sinar Harian has so far organised 44 dialogues to discuss various issues covering topics like the proposed shariah amendment bill, state-owned investment firm 1MDB and the GST.“Sinar Harian is indeed ready to provide space for any parties to discuss various issues,” Norden added.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...r-nazri-debate/"
