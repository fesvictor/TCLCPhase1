When they work with Ama­nah and DAP, then it’s over,” the PAS president said at an event in Ampang yesterday.“If PAS doesn’t want to join (Pakatan Harapan), let it be,” the former prime minister said.PAS and Pribumi had initiated talks on Feb 1 over the matter ahead of the next general election, which is due by June 2018.PAS vice-president Idris Ahmad had said that the party’s participation in Pakatan Harapan was a major decision which could only be made after much discussion over a period of time.On another issue, Abdul Hadi slammed DAP and Amanah for criticising his proposal on the Private Member’s Bill to amend the Syariah Courts (Criminal Juris­diction) Act.“That is one line you should not cross,” he added.Abdul Hadi added that there was no need for PAS to meet with Pribumi leaders to discuss their ties as long as they are friendly with DAP and Amanah.He said PAS will also meet PKR on its ties with the party soon."
