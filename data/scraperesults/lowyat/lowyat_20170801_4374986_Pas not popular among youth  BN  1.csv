emburrar,20170801,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 2,201410,From: Bandar Damai dan Indah,"survey by market research firm Kajidata Research found that only 6.5 per cent of the respondents could relate to the Islamist party, which they also felt was the most unlikely to win the next polls and develop the country.PAS also received the lowest support from Muslims and Malays, their key target communities. Only 9 per cent Muslims and 10 per cent Malays said they backed PAS.PAS was also the least trusted party to develop the country, with merely five per cent of those polled agreeing.DAP at 2.6 per cent, followed by Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (1.9 per cent), and Parti Amanah Negara (0.7 per cent).http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...qV8k0LqqdyLI.97"

You make poll at KV, the result will be different compared to other area like Kelantan, Penang etc. This kind of poll just to sedapkan hati. Unless the number of audience is big enough maybe more than 25k, i would say this poll is pointless."
