The construction is done in an unprofessional and hasty manner without consulting the residents.“Good policies put the interest of the public first. Since there are lots of opposition from local residents whenever a telco tower is built too close to their houses, Sacofa has to engage with them first,” she told a press conference yesterday.Yong, together with Stampin MP Julian Tan and Bandar Kuching MP’s special assistant Dr Kelvin Yii attended a dialogue on this matter with Assistant Minister for Public Utilities Datuk Dr Stephen Rundi, in the presence of Sacofa representatives on Thursday morning.She said the concerns about telco towers were raised and discussed at the dialogue, with Dr Rundi having acknowledged the lack of public engagement in recent construction of telco towers at residential areas.“The assistant minister told the Sacofa officials that they should hold more frequent engagements with the local residents. This should be done on the ground, not at a conference hall as residents may not be able to travel all the way to the city to attend.“He (Dr Rundi) told Sacofa that in places where they intend to build towers, they have to explain the policies and guidelines since many people are still unclear.“We want to work together for a better environment for the people to live in,” she said.Yong said that during the dialogue, she also raised concerns over towers built on land meant for recreational purposes, such as playgrounds.Six controversial sites have been identified and brought to the attention of the assistant minister and Sacofa, namely Taman Supreme, SK Bintawa, Kenyalang Traffic Garden, Batu 12 Penrissen Heights, Stampin Tengah and Taman Kampung Haji Baki.Some of the sites are deemed too close to residential areas, while the one at Stampin Tengah is considered unsafe due to its proximity to a Sesco substation.http://www.theborneopost.com/2017/04/15/pu...tform=hootsuite"
