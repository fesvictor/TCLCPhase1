flexibletuna,20170428,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201608,,"I was at a roundtable last week and they had a few pemuda UMNO leaders and the oldfags together in one place.the youngins accuse the old guard of UMNO for wanting to co-opt PAS into the BN coalition, which they think is a bad idea. while the old ones basically told them there's no such thing, STFU, and stop being so paranoid.after everything went down, i caught up with one of the younger ones and asked him if he can corroborate his claims, he basically just said ""the grassroots are supportive of this idea, so the higher-ups would rather appease their voter base instead of doing the right thing.""betul ke? i dont have any grassroot UMNO friends, so i ask /k."

alexcky,20170501,business Sifu,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 754,200711,,Pas no choice to gang up with bn coz they can't win alone.. But Pas will only get none benefit from bn if they winI agree with pas young generation.. At least they know what's going on
Ibrahimovic,20170501,*HolyHunk*,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,516",200708,From: Johor-Singapore,True but I think that's because young generation don't know how to politics. BN very smart to 'offer' PAS something for the return of guaranteed win. No black and white and BN could easily let go of pas after winning with little repercussions.  It's old school ruthless politic best for old gen

DarkNite,20170501,??? ???B!?,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 10,887",200806,,paid troopers are grassroots?
Ibrahimovic,20170501,*HolyHunk*,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,516",200708,From: Johor-Singapore,True that's the best but that mean no more money under table. And to do that they have to admit they are doing wrong which is political suicide especially when they denied that all these year. Time will tell but I'll bet that BN win big.
ikankering,20170501,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 3,201701,,if pas lose kelantan.pas will say takdir and try again next GE15.same taktik and lose x 10.
