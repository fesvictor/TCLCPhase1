The DAP advisor also refuted allegations that his party dominated Pakatan Harapan and was using the Opposition coalition's leaders to achieve his aim of becoming prime minister.Kit Siang, who is Gelang Patah assemblyman, said all leaders in Pakatan have their own political principles, but at the same time, respected each other’s views.“It never crossed my mind to become PM. It is unthinkable. On top of that, do you believe that former PM Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who held the position for about 22 years, is also my puppet?“We have our own principles. Why should we become other people’s puppet?” he said while having brunch with Kulai voters at the SME Industrial centre, Indahpura here on Sunday.Dr Mahathir, who is Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Pribumi) chairman, claimed that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak had said that Kit Siang would become prime minister if Umno fell.Najib had previously said that Kit Siang was Pakatan Harapan's de facto leader and that he ""calls the shots"" in the coalition.Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan had also asked Kit Siang to ""make a stand"" to either retire from politics or take a more formal position in Pakatan Harapan.The Minister in the Prime Minister's Department was responding to Kit Siang's recent blog post refuting claims that he had control over the other leaders in the Opposition coalition.""To save Malaysia from evil, LKS should resign and retire instead of killing politically potential leaders in DAP such as (Dr) Tan Seng Giaw,"" he said last week.Abdul Rahman was referring to the 2012 DAP party election where Dr Tan, who was then deputy chairman, was ousted from the party's central executive committee.During the same party election, both Kit Siang and his son Lim Guan Eng received the highest number of votes.In response, Kit Siang fired back with claims that the Barisan Nasional strategic communications team, which is headed by Abdul Rahman, was spreading lies about him.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...MyglVD6yUei8.99"
