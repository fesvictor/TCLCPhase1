ironmaid89,20170618,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"Sarawak PAS has proposed that the government implement mandatory screening for aspiring candidates in the country’s elections.Jofri Jaraiee said the government should screen the prospective candidates before they could contest in the elections and he urged that this be implemented for the coming 14th general election.“We do not want this issue to recur because it is a waste of public funds if a by-election is held to replace any elected representative, whether from the government or opposition, found to have dual citizenship,” he said in a statement, here, today.Meanwhile, Sarawak DAP chairman Chong Chieng Jen at a news conference, here, proposed an emergency Sarawak Legislative Assembly sitting within two weeks following the Kuching High Court’s decision to reinstate Dr Ting Tiong Choon as Pujut assemblyman yesterday. “The people in Sarawak need to know and the Chief Minister should apologise,” he said.The High Court had ruled that the state assembly has no express powers to deal with an election result, as it is the exclusive right of the election court. — Bernamahttp://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...h.Zks3PYqG.dpuf"
