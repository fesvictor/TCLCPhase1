Shame on you (or the surrogate who wrote this for you),” he said.A constitutional referendum, which was held throughout Turkey on April 16, saw 18 proposed amendments brought forward by the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) approved.This also means that the Prime Minister’s office will be abolished and the existing parliamentary system replaced with an executive presidency and a presidential system.The number of parliamentary seats were also raised from 550 to 600 while the president is to be given more control over appointments to the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors.The referendum was called following a failed military coup in July last year, which saw mass arrests of journalists, university deans, soldiers, and  government staff some of whom have yet to face trial.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...azizah-erdogan/Wan Azizah: Congratulate To Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdoganhttps://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?showtopi...1&hl=Wan+Azizah"
