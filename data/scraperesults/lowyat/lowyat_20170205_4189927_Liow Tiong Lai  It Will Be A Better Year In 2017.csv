Major cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Johor Baru, Malacca and Kuantan would see a quantum leap in development in the near future.As Transport Minister, he said the ports, railway tracks and systems were being upgraded to enhance connectivity.“No town or village, including Bentong, shall be left out in the country’s development plans,” he told the people here at Bentong MCA division’s Chinese New Year open house yesterday.He said the century-old town would become a good role model to demonstrate that it was possible to transform a quiet town into a prosperous city.“Let everyone witness how this small town transforms into a prosperous city,” he added.A roadshow, he announced, would be held to inform the people on the progress of the development plans while seeking their feedback to map out the future direction of the town.Liow also said that the national-level Chinese New Year open house would be held in the town on Feb 12.“This is a festival celebrated by all races in Bentong.“We not only celebrate the festival, we also popularise this town to make it a major tourist destination,” he added to the crowd’s applause.Earlier in Kuala Lumpur, Liow handed out Chinese New Year goodies to nearly 1,000 elderly and less fortunate people at a charity programme organised by the Welfare Society of Loke Yuen Pudu KL.He gave the assurance that the Government would undertake all measures to boost the economy to reduce the people’s financial burden.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...transformation/"
