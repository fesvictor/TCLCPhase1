big[1],20170205,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 588,201506,,"PITAS: Tiga faktor – kelemahan pembangkang walaupun diberi peluang; hubungan baik dengan China; dan politik murni Barisan Nasional (BN), dijangka menyebabkan peningkatan besar sokongan masyarakat Cina kepada BN pada pilihan raya umum (PRU) akan datang.Menteri Komunikasi dan Multimedia Datuk Seri Dr Salleh Said Keruak berkata walaupun diberi peluang sebagai wakil rakyat atau sebuah kerajaan di peringkat negeri, pembangkang terbukti tidak mampu menyumbang ke arah kebajikan, pendidikan dan ekonomi masyarakat Cina.Salleh berkata masyarakat Cina juga umumnya gembira apabila kerajaan Malaysia dan China menjalin hubungan rapat, yang menyaksikan peningkatan dalam hubungan 2 hala.“Perdana Menteri (Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak) telah melaksanakan tugas dengan baik apabila mengukuhkan hubungan ini dan amat dihormati di China. Hubungan 2 hala dan ekonomi antara Malaysia dan China kini berada pada kedudukan paling kukuh.“Ini sudah pasti meningkatkan pelaburan langsung asing (FDI) dan mewujudkan lebih banyak pekerjaan dan peluang ekonomi untuk rakyat,” katanya, dan menambah ia juga menunjukkan sokongan masyarakat Cina terhadap BN pada PRU14.Salleh berkata demikian ketika menutup sambutan Tahun Baharu Cina daerah Pitas di sini malam tadi.Selain itu, beliau berkata BN mengamalkan politik murni tanpa menyerang mana-mana individu secara peribadi.“Tidak seperti parti pembangkang, politik mereka adalah separuh benar dan turut memanipulasi untuk memenangi jiwa dan minda rakyat,” katanya.Sementara itu, Salleh berkata festival seperti sambutan Tahun Baharu Cina sentiasa menjadi platform penting untuk menggalakkan perpaduan dan keharmonian dalam masyarakat berbilang kaum.Beliau berkata tradisi unik Malaysia harus dikekalkan kerana ia membolehkan pelbagai kaum untuk berinteraksi dan saling hormat-menghormati.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...n-menyokong-bn/"

Simple fact.By giving all the big contracts to mainland Chinese companies, do u think these people will sub out the jobs to local companies? They will instead use own people and suppliers.I've been to many projects under mainland Chinese contractors. Entire project managed by their own people. Locals only for menial tasks like paperwork and translation. Stuff like cement, windows, aluminum frames and even silicone sealants all imported from China in container loads."
