advocado,20170420,Look at all my stars!!,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 2,081",200706,,"Why? Simply because the 2 previous elections are the only election Opposition has any sort of chance at winning.There is no 3rd chance. Don't say economy is bad people will vote Opposition, it's just not going to happen because only small % of people are complaining about bad economy, most typical those at Peninsular.you can't beat the crowd in Sabah & Sarawak no matter how bad the economy is.so the only way forward for the future of the country is to let it die faster, so in hope it can reborn as a better country, or worse.Those that still thinking opposition can win, i don't know how you guys can be so delusional. if you HOPE, yes i understand, but believe? you are out of your mind. Wake up & look at current state.For the sake of the country please vote BN. Let us end this once & for all."

When he's booted out high-ranking figures from even his own party and cabinet for speaking out about the 1MDB, you know you have a truly self-serving, destructive man in the helm.One could vote for BN if they had picked a fresh new candidate (with no affiliation to Najib) to run for PM, but Najib is clearly manning the wheel, and there is no way a lot of good is coming out of continuity with Najib."
