The whole world is watching us so now we are duty-bound to ensure that the case is investigated thoroughly and in a transparent manner,"" he said.Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was killed by two women who splashed a chemical on his face at KLIA2 on Feb 13.Two women, a Malaysian man and a North Korean man have been arrested to assist in the investigations.North Korean ambassador Kang Chol has denounced Malaysia's handling of the investigation, accusing the country of ""colluding"" with Pyongyang's enemies.""The North Korean ambassador was rude and not professional in making these baseless accusations.""There's a reason why he was summoned by our Foreign Ministry,"" said Liow.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...QQfHtfpQFz5u.99"
