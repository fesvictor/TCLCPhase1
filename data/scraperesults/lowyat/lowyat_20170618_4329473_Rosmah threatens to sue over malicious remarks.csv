Avangelice,20170618,In Absolute Control,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 3,353",200806,From: Kuching (The Land of Opportunity),kinda true because DOJ never specifically says it's Rosmah. if you jump the gun it's called slandering in the eyes of the law. so cover your asses people

Small money does not go out, big money does not come in.And Najib's family bodoh bodoh go and receive the gifts. Padan muka."

billylks,20170618,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 89,201005,,"Oh it doesn't work that way. The minister from PM department officially admitted that MO1 was najib before. Now they are refusing to admit MO1 wife is not bik mama? Najib only has 1 wife currently. It is too late to play bodo and refuse to recognise who is whom. The smartest way right now is to challenge DOJ - but they don't want to do it until now. Instead of persecuting those who spread the allegations (which actually are from DOJ itself not that we simply pull them out of our asses), they should sue DOJ."

darthboyzzee,20170618,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"Mrs MO1's pink diamond, gold jewellery not on DOJ hit listThe US$27.3 million 22-carat pink heart-shaped diamond gifted to the wife of the unnamed “Malaysian Official 1 (MO1)” was one of many details in a US expose on 1MDB that has caught the public's attention.However, despite claiming the pink diamond and 27 different 18-carat gold necklaces and bracelets worth US$1.3 million were procured with money allegedly stolen from 1MDB, the item is not on the US Department of Justice (DOJ) list of current forfeitures.A check with the 251-page DOJ civil forfeiture suit filed last Thursday revealed neither Mrs MO1's pink diamond nor the gold jewellery are among the 16 new assets the department wants to seize.https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/385983#ixzz4kKbWIFQL"
