I cry even if Malaysians are dry-eyed. My child is lost. And soon my country. Please excuse me,” Dr Mahathir wrote on his blog.“Proton the child of my brain has been sold. It is probably the beginning of the great sell-out. The process is inexorable. No other way can we earn the billions to pay our debts. The only way is to sell our assets. And eventually we will lose our country, a great country no doubt, but owned by others,” added the country’s longest serving prime minister.The deal between Proton parent DRB-Hicom and Geely was announced yesterday, with Second Finance Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani saying that Proton would remain a national car because Proton would still have a majority hold of 50.1 per cent.International newswire Reuters reported that Geely was expected to offer Proton some vehicle technologies in order to grow its sales overseas and to recover some of the global presence Proton had lost in recent years.MAHATHIR Mohamad bersama-sama kakitangan Proton meraikan pelancaran kereta Proton Saga ke-300,000 pada 1991.Proton reportedly dominated the domestic market by 74 per cent in 1993 at its peak, but saw its market share dwindle to around 15 per cent currently due to low-quality cars, poor after-sales service and tough competition from foreign automakers.Dr Mahathir said he was certain that Proton would now be sold all over the world.“It will be like Singapore. Malaysians are proud of this great city-state. If it had not been sold it would be, perhaps, as well developed as Kuala Kedah or Kuala Perlis. Then we cannot be proud of Singapore,” he said.“Now we can be proud of Proton. With money and superior technology it will compete with Rolls Royce and Bentley. But I cannot be proud of its success. I cannot be proud of the success of something that does not belong to me or my country. Maybe other Malaysians will, but not me,” added the 91-year-old.http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...th-chinese-firm"

Flex,20170525,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 85,200506,"From: Ipoh, Perak.","Protectionism is temporary measure for infant industries to attain growth development and to shield against larger scale existing competitors before they could compete on the same level. But after 30 years of protectionism still unable to achieve this is consider a failure itself. And further to that domestic sales plummeted from 74% in 1993 to merely 15% currently just simply shows how much people are displease with the poor quality cars and poor service of Plotong all these years. Long term protectionism is the main culprit causing it to be non competitive and failure in Plotong, making it to think not much effort is needed to stay afloat."
