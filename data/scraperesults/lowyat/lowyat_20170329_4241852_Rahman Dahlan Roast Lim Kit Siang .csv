Kit Siang part of DAP's problem, claims Rahman DahlanDAP had never once managed to defeat BN during a general election and therefore Lim Kit Siang was not qualified to teach anyone on ""strategy"", said BN strategic communications chief Abdul Rahman Dahlan.Reiterating his call for Lim, the DAP parliamentary leader, to retire from politics, Rahman said it was normal for political leaders to do so upon tasting their first defeat.He said Lim, who had been in politics over the past 51 years and a string of losses, should realise that he was part of DAP's ""problems"".""Lim's 'strategies', if any, had failed him miserably. How to learn strategic lessons from him?""Since Lim has failed to defeat BN in every general elections, maybe he should realise he is not part of the solution. He is part of the problem!"" he said on his Twitter account today...https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/377409#ixzz4ciHM3LUx"
