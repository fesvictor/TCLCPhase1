cindy97,20170725,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201704,,Actually hor even UMNo also dont want MCA and Gelakan already coz no purpose one. In fact even all seats held by mca and gelakan now suppose to belong to Umno coz all are malay majority areas. How long you can tahan bring passenger. Thats why now umno want to buddy2 with Pas which have many supporters all over the country. hence you can see the reason umno becoming more islamic and supporting Pas hudud. All just to attract Pas and its supporters to support BN.
