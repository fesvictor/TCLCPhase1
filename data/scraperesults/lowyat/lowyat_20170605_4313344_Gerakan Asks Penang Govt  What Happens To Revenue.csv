Those flouting the law can be fined RM250.Oh said based on a recent survey at two recycling shops in George Town, copper and aluminium recyclables yielded high prices, while used compact discs also fetched high prices.Oh said Penang’s city and municipal councils require recycling centres to obtain licences.He said the yearly licences were between RM50 and RM100.“Those who do not separate waste can be fined RM250 or brought to court and fined RM2,000. And imposing licensing fees on recycling centres are also revenue streams,” Oh said.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...7/06/05/786465/"
