darthboyzzee,20170201,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"Kaedah Mudah Pengiraan Harga Petrol Ron95 di MalaysiaSalam kepada pembaca semua,Kepada anda yang ingin tahu berapa harga sebenar Ron 95 jika dinilai dari pergerakan junam harga minyak hari ini Usd29.xx per barrel.Fakta bergambar dan huraian di bawah in sya Allah membantu.Harga runcit produk petroleum di Malaysia ditentukan melalui kaedah Automatic Pricing Mechanism (APM) sejak tahun 1983.Harga Lowest di bawah Usd30 iaitu Usd29.37 dicatatkan pada 15 januari 2016. Jangkaan analisis harga ke area Usd25.xx Harga Lowest Terbaru Pada 16 januari 2016Harga Minyak terkini di pasaran.Melalui APM, Kerajaan akan menetapkan harga runcit pada satu paras tertentu di mana perubahan kos produk tidak akan mengubah harga runcit. Perbezaan antara harga runcit dengan harga sebenar akan ditampung oleh subsidi dan pengecualian cukai jualan.Komponen-komponen yang terdapat didalam Automatic Pricing Mechanism (APM) adalah seperti berikut:1. Kos produk (MOPS)Malaysia menggunakan harga purata harian ""Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS)"" di pasaran Platts sebagai asas untuk menentukan kos poduk bagi RON97, RON95 dan Diesel. Platts merupakan pasaran harian produk petroleum yang diterbitkan oleh McGraw Hill Companies Limited di Singapura. Kebanyakan negara di rantau ini juga menggunakan MOPS sebagai rujukan kos produk petroleum mereka.2. AlphaPerbezaan harga yang dipaparkan di pasaran Platts dengan harga belian sebenar oleh syarikat minyak. Kerajaan telah menetapkan Alpha pada kadar 5 sen seliter untuk petrol dan 4 sen seliter bagi diesel.3. Kos operasiTerdiri daripada kos pengangkutan dan kos pemasaran. Pada masa ini, Kerajaan menetapkan kos operasi pada kadar 9.54 sen hingga 9.58 sen seliter.4. Margin syarikat minyakDitetapkan pada 5 sen seliter bagi petrol dan 2.25 sen bagi diesel.5. Margin pengusaha stesenDitetapkan pada 12.19 sen seliter bagi petrol dan 7 sen seliter bagi diesel.6. Cukai jualanDiwartakan dibawah Akta Cukai Jualan 1972 dengan kadar 58.62 sen seliter bagi petrol dan Cukai jualan bagi diesel telah dinaikkan daripada 19.64 sen seliter kepada 40 sen seliter berkuatkuasa mulai 1 Februari 2009.7. SubsidiSubsidi diberikan apabila harga sebenar lebih tinggi daripada harga runcit yang ditetapkan setelah mengambilkira pengecualian cukai jualan.Harga rujukan bagi kiraan APM adalah Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS). Ini merupakan harga minyak yang sudah diproses. (Makulumat lanjut tentang MOPS boleh di-Google).Harga MOPS dicampur pula dengan beberapa kos lain:Note# 1 – Barrel (bbl) = 158.9873 litersNote# 2 – Harga Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) adalah mahal sedikit dari NYMEX. Ini kerana harga yang kita lihat pada NYMEX adalah harga bagi Crude Oil (minyak mentah) sedangkan harga bagi Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) adalah harga rujukan bagi Refined Oil (minyak yang telah siap diproses). Harap anda dapat bezakan antara dua harga ini.Cara Kiraan Harga Petrol Ron 95 Malaysia – image credit to https://www.facebook.com/Khairykj– Kos operasi (9.58 sen/liter)– Margin syarikat minyak (5 sen/liter)– Margin dealer stesen minyak (12.19 sen/liter)– ‘Alpha’ yakni perbezaan MOPS dengan harga pembelian sebenar (5 sen/liter)Jadi Kiraan Sebenar Kiraan Harga Petrol:MOPS + Kos Operasi + Alpha + Keuntungan Syarikat + Keuntungan Stesen Minyak = Harga Sebenar PetrolMOPS + 9.58 sen + 5 sen + 12.19 sen + 5 sen = harga pasaran sebenar petrol di MalaysiaPurata harga MOPS untuk RON95 dari 1 hingga 19 November 2015 adalah 195.15 sen. Campur dengan kos lain diatas = 226.88 sen atau kurang lebih RM2.27.Jadi Bagaimana Pula untuk kiraan harga hari ini ?Penulis akan berikan dua jawapan mudah faham :Jawapan 1 (Kaedah *Pekali , orang kampung mudah faham)Purata harga Rm1.50 - Rm 1.60 adalah yang munasabah untuk Ron95 Januari dan februari 2016.Namun *pekali ini agak kejam buat rakyat andaikata harga minyak mencanak naik Usd100 per barrel akan datang.Wallahualam.Maksudnya.Uds100 / 18.502 = Rm5.40 seliter bagi ron95.Jawapan 2 (Kaedah kiraan detail, yang ini untuk yang jenis mencari bukti kukuh)Chart Harga terkini MOPS boleh dilihat di SINISemoga kerajaan dapat kaji semula kiraan :MOPS + Kos Operasi + Alpha + Keuntungan Syarikat + Keuntungan Stesen Minyak = Harga Sebenar Petrol Untuk kepentingan anak cucu kita akan datang.Apa-apa pun kita doakan semoga harga minyak kembali stabil kerana melibatkan syarikat kesayangan Negara iaitu Petronas.Semoga Allah mudahkan segala urusan dan semuanya penuh dengan hikmah.http://www.piphijau.com/2016/01/kaedah-mud...rga-petrol.html"

He is also a coward for hiding behind a pseudonym and claims as being known by the government and police. Complete BS. Last time he blasted ""Merdeka Centre"" polls which shown that BN popularity is down being opposition propaganda (funded by Soros, funded by USA CIA).. THEN he proceeded to use the same Merdeka Centre surveys against PKR during the Kajang Move fiasco that shows PKR having negative outlook.I still remember his argument against Tony Pua and Rafizi. He blasted them for using crude oil price and said it's based on Brent calculation and gave some confusing American website with random formulas. Now MOGAS pulak. He is a wannabe ""economist"". All he does is pull statistics without context and spin it as favourable propaganda. Whenever he gets refuted by even economic degree undergraduates, he dodges and cites even more nonsense like Starbucks and Mercedes having record sales = Malaysians are rich.He also once said Najib wouldn't be dumb enough to deposit the 1MDB money inside his personal account and laughed at Sarawak Report. End up still jilat him..I'm 100% convinced he's a paid cybertrooper. That's just sad knowing these shills exist and earn their living for spewing propaganda and spinning statistics and economic jargon to influence public opinion."

Today Malaysia imports roughly 45% of its refined products (petrol, diesel, kerosene etc) 3. The Pengerang refinery will reduce this reliance on imports, but we SHOULD import if the price is lower due to arbitrage between markets.4. The imports don't only come from Singapore refineries but also from refineries in the region (China, India) and sometimes even from the Middle East. Depends on the price.5. There has been little investments in refineries in Malaysia over the past few decades due to Malaysia's price-controlled regime6. It's very difficult for any sensible business to invest billions in a refinery when the already tight margins can be threatened by non-market pricing (e.g. they might be forced to sell at a loss)7. This picture is gradually changing after we move to a 'managed float' that is clearly linked to a market price (e.g. the Chinese purchase of the Shell refinery in PD, and that proposal for a 200k bpd refinery in Kedah   )8. The market price is a regional market price, as the product can move between countries in Asia and Australia. 9. Singapore is a center of physical and virtual trading due to their investments in tankage and financial services (see, that word investment again. Why no such investments in Malaysia? Controlled pricing, again)10. Singapore also has the advantage of freely tradeable USD, making trading (a low margin, high volume business) more profitable over in Singapore compared to Malaysia. Singapore's economy is structured quite differently than ours, so they can afford to do that (no commodities to worry about crashing)HTH"

Kos produk (MOPS)Malaysia menggunakan harga purata harian ""Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS)"" di pasaran Platts sebagai asas untuk menentukan kos poduk bagi RON97, RON95 dan Diesel. Platts merupakan pasaran harian produk petroleum yang diterbitkan oleh McGraw Hill Companies Limited di Singapura. Kebanyakan negara di rantau ini juga menggunakan MOPS sebagai rujukan kos produk petroleum mereka.2. AlphaPerbezaan harga yang dipaparkan di pasaran Platts dengan harga belian sebenar oleh syarikat minyak. Kerajaan telah menetapkan Alpha pada kadar 5 sen seliter untuk petrol dan 4 sen seliter bagi diesel.3. Kos operasiTerdiri daripada kos pengangkutan dan kos pemasaran. Pada masa ini, Kerajaan menetapkan kos operasi pada kadar 9.54 sen hingga 9.58 sen seliter.4. Margin syarikat minyakDitetapkan pada 5 sen seliter bagi petrol dan 2.25 sen bagi diesel.5. Margin pengusaha stesenDitetapkan pada 12.19 sen seliter bagi petrol dan 7 sen seliter bagi diesel.6. Cukai jualanDiwartakan dibawah Akta Cukai Jualan 1972 dengan kadar 58.62 sen seliter bagi petrol dan Cukai jualan bagi diesel telah dinaikkan daripada 19.64 sen seliter kepada 40 sen seliter berkuatkuasa mulai 1 Februari 2009.7. SubsidiSubsidi diberikan apabila harga sebenar lebih tinggi daripada harga runcit yang ditetapkan setelah mengambilkira pengecualian cukai jualan.Harga rujukan bagi kiraan APM adalah Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS). Ini merupakan harga minyak yang sudah diproses. (Makulumat lanjut tentang MOPS boleh di-Google).Harga MOPS dicampur pula dengan beberapa kos lain:Note# 1 – Barrel (bbl) = 158.9873 litersNote# 2 – Harga Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) adalah mahal sedikit dari NYMEX. Ini kerana harga yang kita lihat pada NYMEX adalah harga bagi Crude Oil (minyak mentah) sedangkan harga bagi Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) adalah harga rujukan bagi Refined Oil (minyak yang telah siap diproses). Harap anda dapat bezakan antara dua harga ini.Cara Kiraan Harga Petrol Ron 95 Malaysia – image credit to https://www.facebook.com/Khairykj– Kos operasi (9.58 sen/liter)– Margin syarikat minyak (5 sen/liter)– Margin dealer stesen minyak (12.19 sen/liter)– ‘Alpha’ yakni perbezaan MOPS dengan harga pembelian sebenar (5 sen/liter)Jadi Kiraan Sebenar Kiraan Harga Petrol:MOPS + Kos Operasi + Alpha + Keuntungan Syarikat + Keuntungan Stesen Minyak = Harga Sebenar PetrolMOPS + 9.58 sen + 5 sen + 12.19 sen + 5 sen = harga pasaran sebenar petrol di Malaysia"

happyking4ever,20170203,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 192,201502,,"well the chart actually explains much of what i have observed in the past. several times in the past, i have thought the price would increase but it end up did not, and those months were clearly shown as subsidies in the chart. and we could see subsidizes also got balanced by tax in other months when there were people complaining that our petrol price seemed to be higher than it should be.therefore, it is actually more constructive to admit that there have been some adjustment to the prices all along, instead of strictly following the formula. grant that, the adjustments did balance each other out. so from me personally, i could accept that. but BN troopers should really stop provoking others for saying others lies etc because the figures themselves did not follow formula strictly. therefore, for those people who analyze the differences and detected unexpected increase, it is normal for them to voice out their doubts. Between Jan and Feb, there is a net adjustment of RM$0.10, that's quite substantial and it is not unusual that people sense something is wrong and voice it out.from the chart, it was shown that Jan 2016 should have gone up higher but it did not, and the shortfall was recouped in Feb 2017, though an increase of RM0.15 would have been more politically friendly. But anyway Feb is a shorter month and maybe Mar will have a small subsidy to balance it out."

The table posted by some earlier clearly show, subsidy or surpluses are set arbitrarily. Some months surplus some subsidized. There is no consistency there.So, the point I am trying to put is that you cannot blame the people of being skeptical on the prices fixed by the government when they have not been transparent with the pricing mechanism in the first place.The bottom line is ..even with the formula given, we still cannot ascertain for a fact on the actual price of petrol because ...the government can suka hati give subsidy or charge surplus without any SOP.

Even the national budget has to be tabled every year for public consumption. Not all countries have a managed float like we do. Most of them float the rate with retailers setting the final price which I'm sure you're already aware of. They have roughly the same method of calculation as ours but ours doesn't always match the assumed formula. Fuel pricing affects the pricing of everything else so it's not an isolated problem."

scorptim,20170203,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 378,200911,,"Those other countries have pretty much made it openly clear that they are making a profit and taxing their citizens for the fuel. Therefore no need to provide information on the fuel price structure la. Just like how businesses will not show you how they price their products. It's the same concept. Our government claims to not tax us for the fuel and they are not making profit from it, despite the opposition asking them if they are taxing us or making profit since we chose to allow the fuel price to float. That's why they need to be transparent, to prove that they are indeed not taking or making profit from us. For me it's simple either admit you're making a profit and taxing us, otherwise show proof of how you set the price if you really are not making anything out of it."

No need set how much each station should earn, no need protect the distro with buffer etc. If those who think it is not sustainable, just get out of the business. Every business is all about competing and who has the ex-stock to compete. So why protect protect, then release all these shit about MOPS etc. Just do away with the protek and let every brands or stations set their own price."
