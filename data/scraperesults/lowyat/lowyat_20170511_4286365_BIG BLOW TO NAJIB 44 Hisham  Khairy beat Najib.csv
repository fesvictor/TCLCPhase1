From the 162 participants, Bersatu’s Bureau of Policy and Strategy formulated the questionnaire.It then conducted face-to-face interviews with 2,881 Malaysians in more than 30 constituencies. The respondents consist of 52.2% men and 47.8% women older than 21.The breakdown was 23.1% of the respondents were from cities, towns (49.8%), interiors (19.8%) and settlements like Felda (7.2%).The racial profile was 67.6% Malay, Chinese (23%), Indians (5.6%) and Sabah And Sarawak natives (3.7%).The study was conducted between July and August 2016 before Bersatu was formed.NO CHANCE FOR NAJIB – 52% AGAINST HIM BEING PM VS ONLY 20% FOR IMMEANWHILE, according to Malaysiakini:A survey commissioned by some of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s (Bersatu) founding members found PAS to be the most popular party as at the middle of last year, surpassing even BN.The face-to-face survey of 3,000 respondents found 44.4 percent expressing support for PAS, compared to BN’s 36.2 percent, and PKR’s 25.9 percent.Meanwhile, 16.7 percent said they opposed PAS, compared to BN and PKR, which were each opposed by 27.2 percent of the respondents. The remainder said they were unsure.However, despite this, the survey also found the leaders who would later head Bersatu to be their top picks for the prime minister’s post.Bersatu president Muhyiddin Yassin was the favourite for the post with support from 37.3 percent of the respondents, followed by Bersatu chairperson Dr Mahathir Mohamad (35.9 percent) and PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang (34.3 percent).PKR de facto leader Anwar Ibrahim came out as the sixth most popular, at 27 percent, while the current prime minister Najib Abdul Razak was the ninth most popular (20 percent), with a sizeable portion of respondents (52 percent) opposing him.Among BN leaders, Defence Minister Hishamuddin Hussein (with 26.4 percent support) came out more popular than Najib and Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar (23.3 percent)."

Donphatz,20170511,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,200901,From: PJ,Najib want hisham the next PM because if other people they can make him rot in jail for the 1MDB thing. Hisham is his blood line so wont dare to do that. KJ?. He is populist. He will definitely make it happen(najib to be prosecuted) as it will make him more popular with the voters aka rakyat.
