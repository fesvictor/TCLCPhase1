This was followed by numerous messages over the next few months.On June 5, the police officer was told by a friend that the MACC officer had asked for RM3,000 a month or else he would be arrested by the MACC.Central Seberang Prai OCPD Asst Comm Nik Ros Azhan Nik Abdul Hamid said: “The MACC officer claimed he was in charge of monitoring illegal gambling activities.“The police officer met the suspect at about 9.30pm on Thursday at a petrol kiosk in Seberang Jaya where the demand was made”The suspect then asked the police officer to turn up with the money the next day, ACP Nik Ros Azhan said in a statement yesterday.“At 10.20pm on Friday, they met at a restaurant in Taman Machang Bubok where the suspect was handed the money.“He was subsequently arrested and brought to the district police headquarters for questioning.“Other than the money, we also confiscated two 9mm SME-type bullet shells, a Volkswagen Polo Sedan, a smartphone, a backpack, a pair of pants, his authority card and MyKad from him,” he said.ACP Nik Ros Azhan said investigations showed that the suspect had served with the MACC for 16 years and was in the Intelligence Unit (Northern Zone) at the MACC headquarters in Putrajaya.He has since been remanded pending investigations into the case classified as extortion under Section 384 of the Penal Code.The suspect, who is married with three children, hid his face in his orange lock-up attire when he arrived at the court.Magistrate Nurulrasyidah Mohd Akit then granted a three-day remand until tomorrow.The MACC said in a statement the commission would not compromise on any wrongdoing, and it would cooperate with the police.“We (the MACC) welcome the stern action by the police and will not interfere in the investigations.“The MACC will also be conducting its own examination to prevent such an incident from recurring.“Stern action will be taken against those who damage the reputation of the MACC,” the statement"

LamTin,20170611,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201010,,Extortion or blackmail offence is under jenayah berat polis. Now not polis bribing the macc officer. Its macc officer extorted polis by threatening will expose the polis receiving bribe from gangster illegal gambling activity.Cases like lge rumah banglo corruption case then investigation under macc department.
