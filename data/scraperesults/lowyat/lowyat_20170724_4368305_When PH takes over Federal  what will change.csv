clydefrog,20170724,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 22,201302,,Expect BN to form a very powerful opposition. First few years will be spent blaming BN for everything that happened in the past and BN trying to dig up dirt on PH as much as possible. After a few (maybe 10 or more) years Malaysia will develop a mature 2 party democratic system with proper checks and balances restored. Short term will be choppy but long term its necessary.
