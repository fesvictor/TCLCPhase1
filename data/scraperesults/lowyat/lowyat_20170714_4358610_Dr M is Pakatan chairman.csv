I am not going give my vote for the possibility of this man becoming PM again. I know many in /k will disagree with this and will talk about looking at the bigger picture, but this is my decision as it is PH's decision to make him their Chairman. Hope all those kampung votes they expect to get by dealing with the devil is worth it. I'm out, good luck to this country."

Let the young blood lead the country, for crying out loud."

They are just a group of normal tom, dick and harry just like you and me with all their quirks and foibles.

The only guard against any political parties abuse of power is the check and balances in the various national institutions. Once this is compromised, the country is more or less doomed.Now who almost single-handedly systematically destroyed the various institutions that are supposed to guard us during his twenty odd years in power?

You might think the other members of PH can check this man, but looking at the historical record of the almost comical decisions and actions of most of them, I have no confidence. With what this man has done to this country, I am truly disappointed that the other PH leaders can work with him, much less make him their leader. I am not surprised though, since as I have noted above - most politicians only look out for No. 1.You can go ahead and trust their manifestos and plans, whatever.

Kopitiam",Group: Elite,"Posts: 1,659",200702,From: KL,"The concern about 'win first' isnt about it not being possible, but the fact that the win is tenuous. If the margin is razor thin, absolutely nothing stops a party from threatening to join the other side. Pas can demand for the hudud law to be passed, or mahathir can demand for mukhriz to be in the top post. Whichever side takes up the offer gets to be government."

Is it possible for those candidates who compete in GE sign an agreement if they want to lompat parti after win, they need to vacant the seat 1st so the rakyat who vote for the sake of party won't feel fooled by them and can vote another time?"
RobUlstan,20170714,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 89,201012,,Thats easy to say but you are dealing with devil to get what you want. It's like allying with Mephistopheles to fight Baphomet. I think a lot of people don't see the potential danger of that man. All are blinded by the current enemy they don't see the big hole at their feet. And for what? I don't believe at all that Mahathir and PPBM will be able to influence the rural votes by much. And pls remember that all the PPBM members and candidates are ex-umno members who are fighting for position and money just like they were in their old organization. They're not fighting for Malaysia. You trust these people once they have been elected? Good luck.
