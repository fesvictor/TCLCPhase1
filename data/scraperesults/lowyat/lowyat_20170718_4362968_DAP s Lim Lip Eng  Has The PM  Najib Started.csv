The first phase of 21km with 12 stations, is now extended to 51km with an additional 19 stations, seven of which are underground.Lim also touched on the ticketing systems and benefits for some segments of society when using the subway or MRT lines overseas.“As incentives, train companies in New York, London, Hong Kong, Singapore and many other cities encourage passengers to buy travel passes at huge discounts for convenience.“Discounts are given to senior citizens, students, persons with disabilities and even for off-peak travelers. However, our MRT has none of these except for a petty discount for Touch N Go users,” he said.He called for the government to come out with various discounted travel passes for different categories of users, including those that can be used by tourists.“Perhaps Malaysia can then claim to have the cheapest MRT travel pass in the world?”http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...t-mrt-asks-dap/"

YellowKingValley,20170718,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 398,201412,,Adding those features that LLE requested requires senior citizen/student/disabled ID cards (or maybe MyKad) which are compatible with MRT ticketing system.
