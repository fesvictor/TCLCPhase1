Its deputy chief Khairul Azwan Harun (pix) said an independent probe should be conducted to ensure there is no cover up on the issue.  ""We want to know BNM's real financial position and whether there was a higher loss recorded by the central bank in the early 1990s,"" he told a press conference at its headquarters here Monday. It was reported that former Bank Negara Malaysia assistant governor Datuk Abdul Murad Khalid revealed that the central bank had suffered US$10bil in forex market losses in the early 1990s, far higher than it had admitted.  Abdul Murad questioned why no one was investigated or charged for what he described as one of the biggest forex losses in the world.  The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) said it would only step in when internal investigations unearth any element of corruption.  “If they find any element of corruption, the report should be submitted to MACC and we will open an investigation,” said its deputy chief commissioner (operations) Datuk Azam Baki.  Khairul Azwan also said that based on the youth wing's research, the figures are higher than reported, including forex trading exposure estimated at US$150bil (RM664.13bil), while forex trading losses could have reached beyond US$30bil (RM132.83bil).  ""The massive figures prompted us to push the Government to establish an RCI.  ""This is why we want the Government to investigate whether there was any cover-up on the matter.  ""If there is any cover-up, it should be seen as a crime.  ""The RCI will determine the individuals who tried to manipulate and cause huge losses to BNM.  ""We want the culprits to be brought to justice,"" he added.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...X8Vr7RFB0bl7.99"
