It is unfortunate that the former prime minister is resorting to fear tactics to draw away political support from the government,” he said.Yesterday, Mahathir criticised the leadership of the ruling government under Prime Minister Najib Razak, saying it had terrorised the opposition by taking legal action against opposition leaders.“The nation will remember the 5th Bersih demonstration. He (Najib) declared that he would not ban it. But we all know the strenuous efforts he made to prevent the demonstration from taking place, or at least to reduce the scale,” he had said on his blog."
