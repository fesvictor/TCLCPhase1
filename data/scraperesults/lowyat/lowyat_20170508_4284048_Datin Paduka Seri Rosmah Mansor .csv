darthboyzzee,20170508,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,Wayang is better than not doing anything. At least someone is taking benefit from it.  Also I noticed that PH doesn't seem to even bother to do charity campaign anymore. They keep doing the hate/person-attack campaign right now.

~Sherlock~,20170508,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 39,201010,,then why pick on adun DU? this is not an apple to apple comparison. As part of the govt of course Rosmah has a stronger influence on government agencies compared to a normal MP. DU MP is not even in the education ministry!

Standard ad hominem.So far I know, permata pintar is like one of those elite program with almost unlimited funds and glorify on world class projects, and world class affairs. Results? no proof required, only have faith that some of our top students made it far thanks to the program."

I'm not a macais to speak in defense of adun DU.But I also understand why people have problem with it. First of all, she has no official position in government, managing a program that receive millions of funds every year. In other words, program bapak dia punya.But of course its her brain child. She was the one who founded the program. Surely having someone of that stature and influence would benefit the program. The program itself is a good indication of progress in a developing nation. I just hate to hear a noble program like this end up like YPeIM, becoming a tool for the director for corruption."

I can see why you're in this field.I'm bothered by the way your camp are able to spin the news that DS Rosmah helping a girl procure a scholarship has anything to do with ADUN DU doing her job. Somehow, you're changing the thread by being defensive about DS Rosmah credibility being the Permata Pintar boss, which is probably your prime objective in the first place. Like I said before, I have no interest in who is right or wrong, or angel/devil in the issue, as long as the good work is benefiting."
