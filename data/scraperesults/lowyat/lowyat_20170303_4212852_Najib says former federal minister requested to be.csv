Leaders can come and go but the BN must remain to administer this fortunate land of Malaysia.“Our struggle is a continuous one, from one leader to another, and that’s why Malaysia is successful,” he said.Najib advised the people against falling for the persuasions of the opposition, saying that this would only be to their detriment.He said the opposition was not bothered if the issues they raised were true or false.""They do not care because that's not their objective.Their intention is to intimidate the people or confuse them.""I have spoken to them. They say that for the opposition it is not important if something is right or wrong, so long as the people lose trust in the government. Then the objective is achieved,"" he said.- Bernama"
