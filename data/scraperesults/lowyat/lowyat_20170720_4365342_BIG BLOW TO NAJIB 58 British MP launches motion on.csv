expendables,20170720,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201310,,"https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/8093/VETERAN British lawmaker Ann Clwyd has launched an early day motion (EDM) to debate the 1Malaysia Development Bhd scandal in the House of Commons, London.According to the notice of motion published on Wednesday, the EDM on 1MDB was slotted as item No. 212 on the agenda.“That this House is alarmed about allegations of the misappropriation of billions of dollars from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state-owned investment firm intended to promote economic development in Malaysia, including by the current Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak,” Clwyd, Labour MP for Cynon Valley, said in the EDM.“The EDM notes the ongoing investigations in a number of countries, including the US and Switzerland and further notes the statement by the FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, in connection with the largest single action so far by the US Department of Justice’s Kleptocracy Asset Initiative, that the Malaysian people were defrauded on an enormous scale.“The EDM wants to highlight the continuing restrictions on freedom of expression and of association in Malaysia, as well as the misuse of the Sedition Act, targeted particularly at government critics, including opposition politicians and MPs, such as Anwar Ibrahim, jailed following legal proceedings which fell far short of international standards, and Rafizi Ramli MP.“It further encourages the government of Malaysia to allow international observers, including from a range of Commonwealth countries, at its upcoming general elections, to demonstrate its commitment to free and fair elections, particularly given that Malaysia will be taking up the Chair-in-Office of the Commonwealth in 2020.”The EDM also called on Malaysia to ensure that allegations of misappropriated funds from the country having been used to buy assets in the UK was thoroughly investigated.The US Department of Justice (DoJ) filed a suit to seize a penthouse, office building and a flat on Stratton Street in London on June 7.The DoJ said that Malaysian businessman Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, had financed the purchases, worth around £77 million (RM416 million) from funds allegedly siphoned from 1MDB.The office in Mayfair, which was bought for £42 million in 2014, was the headquarters for Myla, a British lingerie company which Jho Low owned, the DoJ said.The DoJ also filed a suit in July 2016 seeking to seize about US$1 billion (RM4.4 billion) of assets – such as artworks and real estate in New York and Los Angeles – bought with funds allegedly stolen from 1MDB, making it the largest case under its kleptocracy asset recovery initiative."

PappyBoyington,20170720,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/389230A United Kingdom opposition MP has tabled an early day motion (EDM) in the House of Commons highlighting the 1MDB issue.The motion by Ann Clwyd from the Labour Party stated that the House was alarmed by the allegation of misappropriation that supposedly took place in 1MDB, and encouraged the Malaysian government to allow international observers to be present in the 14th general election.“(This is) to demonstrate its (Malaysia’s) commitment to free and fair elections, particularly given Malaysia will be taking up the Chair-in-Office of the Commonwealth in 2020.“(The House) calls on the government to ensure that allegations of misappropriated funds from Malaysia having been used to buy assets in the UK is thoroughly investigated,” the motion read.It also highlighted that restrictions are being imposed on government critics and opposition MPs in Malaysia, including the incarceration of former opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim “following legal proceedings which fell far short of international standards”.However, the EDM has garnered little support since it was tabled on July 18.As of writing at 4pm Malaysian time today, only three MPs have expressed support for the motion, including Clwyd.The other two MPs who have pledged their support for the motion are Alan Brown of the Scottish National Party and Jim Shannon of the Democratic Unionist Party.In contrast, the most popular EDM for the current 2017-19 UK parliamentary session, which calls for a fairer pension scheme for women, has garnered 182 signatures so far since it was tabled on June 27.This is not the first time an EDM mentioning 1MDB has been tabled in the UK Parliament, however.On Nov 9, 2015, a motion also brought by Clwyd called attention to restrictions on space for public debate and free speech in Malaysia following the 13th general election and the 1MDB scandal.The motion received bipartisan support, albeit only from 18 MPs."

I mean, it's a civil suit right?just go to DoJ and negotiate a settlement, like you like to order, just show DoJ the source and proof of where riza got the money....easy right?but then riza don't even dare set foot on USA anymore, or else he kena arrest, kan kan kan?and if he wants to travel anywhere outside of Malaysia, he has to ride in kapal terbang PM...."
