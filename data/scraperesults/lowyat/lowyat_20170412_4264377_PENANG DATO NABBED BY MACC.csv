They are said to have big property development projects in Tanjung Bungah and Kepala Batas.Yesterday, MACC said the land scandal involved the disposal of hundreds of acres of real estate, following an investigation of another Datuk arrested on March 29, involving the same foundation.The 70-year-old Datuk was arrested for his alleged involvement in obtaining gratification worth millions through his position as a director of the foundation.The Datuk was remanded for five days and later released on RM100,000 bail after MACC failed to extend the remand at the Magistrate’s Court.Dah dahI donasi brim semua settleSimpleAlso insert issit formula.

MustyBalls92,20170412,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 103,201505,,"you mean this ?https://www.penang.gov.my/dmedia/485-speech...-february-2009-SPEECH BY YAB TUAN LIM GUAN ENG, CHIEF MINISTER OF PENANG IN CONJUNCTION WITH PENANG STATE GOVERNMENT HARD CORE POVERTY ERADICATION FUND RAISING CEREMONY ON 25 FEBRUARY 2009Speech By YAB Tuan Lim Guan Eng, Chief Minister Of Penang In Conjunction with Penang State Government Hard Core Poverty Eradication Fund Raising Ceremony On 25 February 2009Speech By YAB Tuan Lim Guan Eng, Chief Minister Of Penang In Conjunction with Penang State Government  Hard Core Poverty Eradication Fund Raising Ceremony  On 25 February 2009Dato'  Khor Teng Tong, Executive Chairman, Hunza Properties BerhadMs Daisy Ooi, Managing Director, Hunza Properties BerhadDonors to the Hardcore Poverty Eradication FundState Executives Councilors,Yang Berhormat-Yang Berhormat,Distinguished guestsMembers of the pressLadies and gentlemenGood evening to everyone.I am honored to be invited here today for the combined efforts of Hunza Properties Berhad and its 25 business associates and friends who have pledged to support the Penang State Government's program to eradicate hard core poverty hardship in Penang. This is another instance of a successful public-private-partnership (PPP) that the state government is promoting.  Without the effort and cooperation from the Private sectors, this event will never be a success. Together we work towards the strength and betterment of our beloved state.As I have said before, a government must have a soul, a government that gives its people faith, hope and love. We must earn the people's trust and show them that this government is here to help them and not hurt them. Then we must create an environment that promotes fairness and equality which gives hope to our future generations. Last but not least, a government must love its people to form a real caring society. In this effort, Hunza Properties is doing a great job and we hopes more and more privates firms in Penang will do the same.After taking over power in Penang in March 8 last year, we couldn't believe that in a developed state like Penang we can still find the hardcore poverty families with a monthly income of less than RM430. There are nearly 1,000 hard-core poor families in Penang. The Penang State Government intends to eliminate its existence by lifting the monthly household income to RM500 to provide for basic food and nutritional needs.As a people-centric government committed to ensuring political liberties, equal economic opportunities and social justice, the plight of the poor, especially the hard-core poor, is one of our key priorities.We have launched Partners against Poverty (PAP), which is a concerted effort to eradicate hardcore poverty with the participation of private sectors and non-governmental organisations. The plan to relieve families from hardcore poverty can be achieved through various ways. Financial assistance could come from the Welfare Department, the State Government's Special Fund or from private sectors via an adoption plan.When the programme started, there were 324 families listed as hardcore poor. In the last few months, all our Pakatan Rakyat state assemblyman were required to walk around their constituency to look out for the hardcore families so that we won't miss out any needy. We also sent our invitation of this project to the opposition assemblyman to cooperate and we are happy that some of them give us the feedback. Now we have obtained the final list of hardcore poverty families in the state. The final list has almost 1,000 families listed.Unfortunately, red tape and bureaucratic procedures have prevented the state government from opening a trust fund here where corporations can obtain tax exemption on their contribution to the fund. The delay has hampered our efforts to wipe out hardcore poverty in Penang by March 8 this year.We hope that the federal government will help the poor in the state by speeding up the process of our application to open an account for tax-exemptionWe thank Hunza Properties Berhad which had generously pledged a dollar for every dollar raised by their business associates and friends towards this worthy cause.  They managed to bring together 25 of their business associates and friends who had each pledged RM10,000 totaling RM250,000.  So with Hunza's matching of an equal amount of RM250, 000 the amount raised had come up to a grand total of RM500, 000!  This is a very generous amount despite the current economic scenario and I can assure you that your contribution will be greatly appreciated by the hard core poor who, as mentioned by YB Phee just now, are in need of great help.

The State Government is very grateful to have the support of the rakyat in helping us realize our targeted goals; in this case to alleviate the standard of living for Penangites, i.e. by first ensuring that no family should be left to struggle through life as a hard core poor in Penang.hmmm so he is close to LGE"

nasiputih,20170416,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 32,201405,,"favors are scaryhttps://forum.lowyat.net/topic/3889983/allSRC’s RM170 million returned, says NajibThe RM170 million transferred by SRC International to Putra Perdana Construction in 2014 was for ""turnkey"" construction projects that were later cancelled, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said.In a written reply in Parliament, Najib, also the finance minister, said the money was later returned to SRC International upon cancellation of the project.But Najib added that SRC International had no information over the money the Finance Ministry-owned company allegedly transferred to his personal accounts.""For your information, RM170 million that was paid to Putra Perdana Construction was for the purpose of funding a turnkey development project that was later cancelled, and the money was completely returned to SRC.""SRC has no information about the transfer of funds to the finance minister's accounts, and it is also based on a news report from a portal which could not determine the veracity of its source,"" wrote Najib.Several documents held by Attorney-General Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali during a press conference in January showed SRC International transferred RM170 million to Putra Perdana Construction between July 8 and August 8, 2014.Putra Perdana Construction, in turn, transferred RM34.99 million to Permai Binaraya, which transferred RM27 million to a private bank account ending with the number “880”.Details of the chart held by the attorney-general show transactions involving SRC International and Putra Perdana Construction. – Pic courtesy Tony Pua, March 9, 2016.Details of the chart held by the attorney-general show transactions involving SRC International and Putra Perdana Construction. – Pic courtesy Tony Pua, March 9, 2016.Funds transferred to the “880” account were used to pay for Najib’s Visa and MasterCard bills amounting to RM3.2 million, according to Apandi’s charts.Apandi did not explain why SRC International, a company dealing in energy, was transferring money to a construction outfit.Nor did he explain why some of the money ended up in an account which settled Najib’s credit cards.But Najib said in his reply that he need not explain to the Dewan Rakyat the money trail to his accounts, as it was based on a news report.He was responding to Petaling Jaya Utara MP Tony Pua's question on the purpose of the RM170 million fund transfer, and why it allegedly ended up in the finance minister's bank accounts.In a separate written reply to PKR's Kelana Jaya MP, Wong Chen, Najib said SRC International had no knowledge of another RM42 million reportedly transferred from SRC International to his personal accounts. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported last year that between December 2014 and February 2015, SRC International transferred RM50 million to its subsidiary, Gandingan Mentari, which transferred the RM50 million to Ihsan Perdana.Ihsan Perdana was a private company set up to undertake corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes for 1MDB.From Ihsan Perdana, RM42 million was transferred into Najib’s accounts at AmBank in three deposits of RM27 million, RM5 million and RM10 million, said WSJ.On January 26, Apandi said Najib had not committed any wrongdoing after having examined the investigation papers involving SRC International and an alleged RM2.6 billion donation.This was because Najib was unaware SRC International had transferred money into his accounts, and was under the impression the funds were part of the donation he received from the Saudi royal family, he added. – March 9, 2016.- See more at: http://www.themalaysianoutsider.com/malays...D.pF3PW2mN.dpuf"
