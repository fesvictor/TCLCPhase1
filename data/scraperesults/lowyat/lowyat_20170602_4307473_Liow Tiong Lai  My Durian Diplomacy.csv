Their ministers are hamstrung by the fact the most important parts of their portfolios are under the jurisdiction of others. For example, Liow's Ministry of Transport has little influence over SPAD, the influential (and lucrative) board for public transportation which is actually in the Jabatan Perdana Menteri.MCA is noted for their public service like 1MCA Medical Foundation but as a political entity they are little more than figureheads."

Never mind being called a running dog or just a punching bag to make UMNO look strong.In the end MCA members and their families still ending up with contracts and all. So yeah...they have the power to they don't mind being called anything.Janji kaya.
