A police report should have been made,” he said at a press conference at his Segambut DAP Service Centre in Bandar Manjalara, Kuala Lumpur, yesterday.Lim, along with fellow politicians from DAP has formed a group called ZZJJPTR to help the victims of the Penang-based company.“JJPTR in Mandarin means to help the common folk, so we added ZZ at the front (short for Zen Zen) that roughly translates to really help the common folk,” he said.Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) director Comm Datuk Acryl Sani Abdullah Sani recently said police would begin investigations into the company following a police report made in Johor.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...eir-money-back/"

Politicians from both end learned of the incident, went to the factory with reporters. Take turn holding the fire hose from bomba to take photos for the newspaper, chit chat a bit with the owner then run off after that."
