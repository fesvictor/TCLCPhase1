In other words, he can do anything he wants and yet the people will continue to support the coalition and return BN as the government,” he said.BN won 72 of the 82 state seats in the Sarawak election held in May. Najib, who heads the BN coalition, must call for a general election no later than June 2018.Chong, who is Bandar Kuching MP, criticised the government for raising the price of fuel.He said putting the blame on rising international oil prices did not make sense as the government’s overall oil revenue should also have increased.He said there was nothing wrong in using part of the proceeds from the production and export of oil as petrol and diesel subsidies to benefit the people, especially now when the ringgit was depreciating.The country, he said, was in an economic slowdown and people were finding it extremely hard to make ends meet.“Besides, at the start of the school year, many parents incur extra expenses for their children. This is surely not the right time to increase petrol and diesel prices,” he added.The price of RON 95 and diesel were raised by 20 sen per litre to RM2.10/l and 2.05/l respectively. The price of RON 97 was increased by 15 sen to RM2.40.The finance ministry has defended the move, saying high-income earners were benefiting from the subsidies due to their use of large vehicles.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...f-election-win/"
