Your initial post indicates nothing of having worry over our state of economy but rather a statement blaming the cybertroopers from the other side when in fact, none of that taking place. Are you trying to divert your earlier discussion with oldman_coder ?"

You laugh at their shoddy cheap goods, thinking that is all they produce, ignoring the fact that they are improving at terrifying pace. You only see their weakness, thinking that is all they is, when the fact that they have grown very strong despite of their weaknesses.Meanwhile, while you are laughing, they are buying us off left right and center, and not just us, all over the globe then moan like a lil' bitch about Tongsan this Tongsan that. Keep laughing. Unlike you, I am not. As far as I am concerned, the so called KNN Commies™ are not as weak you like to imagine them to be, and the so called US under that orange fuckface Trump is not as strong as you think they are.Ultimately, it will people like you laughing that will get smacked squarely in the face."

If u read all my post, I said very clear our country is going to crash and more retrenchment coming soonWhy u want to waste time in trump ban this ban that? Shouldn't u worry u out of ur job and no money to feed urself? Most of my client already close down their business and their pity staff no job out of sudden and our pm still said we no need worry.. The currency really hit us hard and what have our minister doing there? Is this political more concern to u? I have get to know more people have been doing 2jobs e.g grab just to sustain their life.. Is that a pathetic situation if u r the pm? Why we have to bear this kind of life while other country have been live their life without worry retrenchment?"

One is extremely liberal to the point of not functioning in reality and the other is a party of opportunists who exploit religion for their own gains.Unless an actual credible third force comes around I guess Malaysia is fucked either way.
