He also questioned how such a large amount of money could have been brought into the house.He said the family was awaiting the outcome of police investigations and was contemplating legal action.He stressed that both he and the family had yet to see the document related to the charges, which did not refer to the raid by the MACC.Ishak has pleaded not guilty and claimed trial to all charges. He was freed on bail of RM30,000. The case is set for mention on March 28.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...engineers-home/"
