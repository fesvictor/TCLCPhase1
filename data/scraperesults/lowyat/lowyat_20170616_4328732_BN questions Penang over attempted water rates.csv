Coup De Grace,20170616,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,201611,,"PETALING JAYA: Barisan Nasional is challenging the DAP-led Penang government to deny that it had sought to significantly increase water tariffs earlier this year and to pledge that there will not be an increase if it retains power in the next general election.According to the Barisan strategic communications team, Penang has already raised the water rates four times - in 2010, 2013, 2015 and had also doubled the state's raw water charges in 2016.Despite that, it allegedly applied to the Federal Water authorities in December 2016 for another round of broad-based water rates increase that would see a 77% increase for domestic consumers and a 58% increase for businesses by April 1, 2017.However, they withdrew the application at the last minute and doubled the water conservation charge instead – a change in direction Barisan suggests was done for ""political reasons"".Barisan attributes the water rate hike to the Penang Water Supply Corporation (PBAPP) that is forecast to lose money and in need of cash flow, which required a RM30mil emergency loan from the Chief Minister's office in this year's budget.Besides that, Barisan also highlighted concerns over the Penang state government's financial health as its yearly operating expenses have increased by 500% since 2008.Further fuelling the worry, it said is Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng's insistence to maintain the state hotel tax despite complaining that the federal tourism tax is too high, adding that the Penang government would benefit from a double tax revenue flow to the state.""Some observers have pointed out that this move is an indication of the Penang government's desperation for money,"" it said.The proposed broad-based water rates increase would give the state government an additional RM150 million per year in revenue.""There is a concern that after the 14th General Election, the Penang State Government will revive the earlier broad-based water rates increase to avoid losses at PBAPP,"" it said.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...GxkXDOZHZQJF.99"

bereev,20170617,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 53,201112,,"this is because surrounding BN state threaten to impose water supply or control the water, Penang has to act first before being taken as hostage , u see the Kedah going to have a new treatment plant at pokok sena soon they will announce something.btw 2016 proposed but due to pakatan no new movement BN has to pick something to play urge pakatan to come out new pm , playing reason rakyat issue include demolish illegal premise and dig and repeat old issue.have to act something to cover DOJ issue"
