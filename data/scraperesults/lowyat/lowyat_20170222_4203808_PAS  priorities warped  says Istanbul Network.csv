lshsl,20170222,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 141,201107,,"PAS’ priorities warped, says Istanbul NetworkPETALING JAYA: The Kuala Lumpur-based Istanbul Network has criticised PAS for what it says is its warped sense of priorities.In an interview with FMT, the think tank’s CEO, Ali Salman, said an Islamist political party should be focusing on economic development instead of prescribing punishments.The Istanbul Network, based in Kuala Lumpur, brings together leaders of think tanks from Muslim countries. Ali hails from Pakistan.“PAS is talking about a criminal code when this should be the last item on its agenda instead of the starting point,” he said.“A starting point for an Islamist party should be to solve problems faced by the people. Islamist parties have to be socially and economically active.”Ali was commenting on PAS’ proposal to amend the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act to increase the severity of punishments.He said Islamist political parties, especially those that operate in multicultural societies, must develop broad policies in the interest of all citizens rather than focus on Islam alone.“In my view, Islamic political parties which focus on Islam alone and not address social and economic issues as well as issues of governance and corruption have a very myopic view of Islam.”He said the success of an Islamist government wasn’t defined by the presence of Islamic laws but by socio-economic indicators.“Have jobs been created? Have investments increased? Is health and education better? These are what define the success of an Islamist government.”Commenting on last Saturday’s rally in support of the PAS-proposed amendments, he said it would not scare off investors as the demands had nothing to do with economic policies.“At most, it will spook individuals but not organisations. The things which scare businesses are mechanisms like price and profit controls.”Ali also spoke on the importance of individual freedom, economic freedom, political freedom and religious freedom to a country’s economy.“Freedoms are a spectrum,” he said. “For a country’s optimal development, these freedoms must exist together. If you have some forms of freedom but not others, you will be holding back a country’s development.”Citing the Egyptian uprising of 2011, he said the suppression of any type of freedom would make people demand for it sooner or later.He said religious freedom was the essence of Islam because of its prohibition of coercion. “If Islamist political parties aren’t ready to give religious freedom, then they aren’t doing justice to Islam.”Ali also commented on talk in social media that Malaysia was going down Pakistan’s path. He said this wouldn’t happen because Malaysia was different from Pakistan for being a multicultural society and having a diverse economy. Furthermore, he added, the two countries’ economic and foreign policies were not similar.He also said there were many misconceptions about Pakistan’s problems being rooted in Islam.“Pakistan’s problems stem from poor governance and its foreign policy. There are extremists, but it’s not because of Islam. It’s manifested in radical Islam, but the root of the problem is that social and economic issues haven’t been addressed for decades.”He said many of Pakistan’s past leaders used Islam as a means of legitimising their rule and developed so-called Islamic policies that were more “form than function”.This was a lesson for Malaysia to learn, he added.“When you have more form than function, then you give Islam a bad name. If you force women to don headscarves or focus on punishing people, then you’re only harming the religion’s image.“If we’re sincere about Islam, we have to be more sensitive to broader socio-economic issues rather than superficial issues. Nothing about religion should be enforced.”sos"

lalabeng,20170222,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201609,,"1. The first verses revealed in the Holy Quran say (what means): ""Read in the name of the Lord, who created man from congealed blood."" This means that the first revealed word was ""read"". This reflects the importance of reading and learning according to Islam.2. The Holy Quran repeatedly orders Muslims to contemplate the universe, creatures, animals, seas, stars, the human body and plants.3. The Holy Quran is scientific in its approach and thus it gives Muslims an example of scientific objectivity and the scientific approach. The Holy Quran often gives proofs to its statements.4. The scientific approach of the Holy Quran is also clear when the Holy Quran requires proofs from the disbelievers for whatever claims they make.5. The Holy Quran gives another example of scientific objectivity by repeatedly blaming disbelievers for their blind imitation of their forefathers. This is certainly an invitation from the Holy Quran to the believers and people to think independently and critically. Independent thinking is an essential condition for creativity, which is the first condition to scientific innovations and technological progress.6. Prophet Muhammad , , urged his Companions to use their own judgment if they faced problems to which there was no specific solution in the Holy Quran or the traditions of Prophet Muhammad . This encouragement of free judgment is a green signal that stimulates people to think, but without going against the principles of Islam.7. Prophet Muhammad , ordered people to record knowledge in books.So many good things the Quran emphasis, any many still delve on haram and hudud. Why not show the world that Islam is a progressive religion instead? The old muslim world champions so many scientific discoveries .... haih..."

Only know how to talk about religion.Once, there might have been a chance for the party to be more than that. Unfortunately, they purged the moderates from the party and now its just a bunch of hardliners who can only talk about religion and nothing else.Nevertheless, its still kind of safe-ish to vote for them as they don't field enough candidates to be able to run this country even if they win all their seats.So yeah...ABU...vote for PAS anyway."
