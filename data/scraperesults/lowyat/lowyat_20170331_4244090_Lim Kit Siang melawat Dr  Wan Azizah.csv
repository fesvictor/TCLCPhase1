Sambil mendoakan kesembuhan, Kit Siang berpesan supaya Presiden Parti Keadilan Rakyat itu berehat secukupnya supaya dapat lekas-lekas kembali beraksi dalam usaha besar menyelamatkan Malaysia daripada kleptokrasi."

""Wan Azizah has been absent from most Pakatan Harapan meetings, even the one held in her office in Parliament yesterday. If she attends those meetings she has to commit herself to the decisions they make. Yesterday she did not attend the meeting as well and the spin-doctors made a big deal about her health and her hospitalisation. And because of that her absence attracted even more attention than it normally should have.""http://www.malaysia-today.net/wan-azizahs-...ting-yesterday/"
