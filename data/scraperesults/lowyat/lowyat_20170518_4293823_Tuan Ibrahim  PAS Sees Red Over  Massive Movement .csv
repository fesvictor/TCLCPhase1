ironmaid89,20170518,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"PAS is crying foul over ""massive movement"" of voters in Kelantan in favour of Barisan Nasional.Its deputy president Datuk Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man said the party intends to file a complaint with the Election Commission (EC).“We will meet the Election Commission to lodge a protest because we have found massive shifting of voters in several constituencies in Kelantan,” he told reporters after chairing a special PAS central working committee meeting at the party headquarters here Thursday.He said the committee will direct PAS lawmakers in 195 state and parliamentary seats to report of any movement of voters in their areas.Tuan Ibrahim said the movement of voters is possible because a new EC ruling does not require the electoral drafts to be made public.He said EC had informed the various political parties of the new ruling on electoral drafts.Temangan assemblyman Datuk Mohamed Fadzli Hassan said the movement of voters is aimed at ousting PAS in the state during the coming general election.“There has been a process of shifting voters. The focus is to increase the number of seats for BN to overthrow the state government. This is undemocratic,” he said.He claimed that voters who were shifted are hardcore Barisan supporters.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...xBYoKF3dVVcP.99"
