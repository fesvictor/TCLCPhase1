But what I know is that Pakatan Harapan has yet to make the final decision.“Personally, I do not agree that both positions are held by PPBM.“There should be consultation with other parties,” he told a press conference here, today.However, when asked his views on whether Dr Mahathir should play the leading role in Pakatan Harapan, Lim said the PPBM chairman should be allowed to ""play a major role"".""After all, he is a former prime minister. He should be allowed to play one of the major roles alongside (PKR president) Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, (DAP adviser) Lim Kit Siang, (Parti Amanah Negara president) Mohamad Sabu and (PPBM president) Muhyiddin."""
