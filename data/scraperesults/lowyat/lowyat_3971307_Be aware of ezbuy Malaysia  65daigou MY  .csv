They claim themselves as 'the only flat rate Taobao forwarder in Malaysia' and today I will show you guys how these crooks trying to slash my throat. I am trying my very best to stay calm as I am typing these, but I really beh tahan with their shitty service and how good they are in giving empty promises. I have been using 65daigou for more than six months and spent alot of money on their services. I will usually opt for their 'Buy-For-me' service, in which I will provide them the Taobao link and pay for the item in MYR (although they do earn from the RMB-MYR exchange rate so its ok I close one eye) and they will help me purchase the item. When I am about to check out the item for the delivery to Malaysia stage, this is what they charge me:For three pair of shoes only, how is it possible for it to weight 8.87KG? ARE THESE SHOES MADE OF STEEL?!!   And because it weighs 8.87KG, the delivery fee is automatically RM99.74. And this amount is delivery of the shoes, not including the cost price of the shoe. So ok lo, I screen shot this and personally inquire ezbuy Malaysia thinking maybe got error. Because for Buy-for-Me service, once item reach their warehouse, they will repack the items to save delivery cost. It is also promised on their website and policy. Then after I consult them, this was their reply:Ya ok I admit I was very pissed when replying them because I really cannot tahan with their shit service. As you guys can see, there are two similar pair of shoes I order, but how come only one pair weigh 7KG but another weigh less than 1KG? Make sense no? It's so obvious that there are errors somewhere but these guys can blatantly give this kind of unprofessional reply.I am so tired of their shit rude feedbacks and snail service. For all the money they spent on advertising and brand rebranding, they should have spend it better on increasing their services and efficiency. There were also couple of times which my parcel arrive much later than the promised ETA. And for those who are wondering why didn't I confront them on their Facebook page or other social media platform instead, this is because ezbuy Malaysia does not allow postings on their Facebook page. I am here just to express my frustration and alerting current and potential ezbuy users. So disappointed with their services. After all my parcels have arrived, I will never ever use their shit service again."

So need to shop all things and checkout at same time. Then you don't need to do anything else just wait for it to arrive. From my experience, this option is cheaper if your item is heavy. For no. 2) There are 3 registered forwarders you can choose from. I guess there's no big difference between them, I just choose the cheapest one. The shipping cost will only be quoted after each items reach the warehouse and weighed. You can shop separately and decide when to ask them to consolidate, pack and ship to you. There are a number of days whre you can keep the items for free in the warehouse,1 week I think.The no. 2 option, is cheaper than the direct shipping if your item is relatively light (below 3kg or so)."

Bought inflatable chair which as a cover packaging (ie a bag to keep the chair in), and in the warehouse the staff chatted with me. ""u have defect a bit, i refund rm2"" and show grainy picture of what looks like the packaging torn. I asked ""is it the cover that is defected?"" and he said ""yes"" so I said refund accepted. And the item arrived. No, not the packaging defect, THE INFLATABLE CHAIR ITSELF WAS TORN. LITERALLY GOT HOLE. How to use? I send picture in chat. they say "" eh i thought you understand us, we meant cover as the chair itself"" wah so shit ah your English. obvious want to cover own ass. I pestered again and they ask for ""proof of picture that chair is not inflatable anymore"" . So I fill the chair and I send a picture of the deflated chair (literally become lembik after 10 mins because you know, got HOLES  ). and they said THEY CANNOT SEE so can only refund 30%.

Compared to other agents, they charge a slightly lower shipping rate, but they charge you an incredibly high conversion rate, which end up is more expensive compared to others and/or direct buy from taobao. Besides, I have experienced many times about their poor customer service. They never hear your complaints, although the delivery was late than promised date, they never say sorry, they only say the parcel has been prioritized, they can't do anything at the moment, except for a sound-like-computerized apology. So what for to set the date while can't even stick with it for many times? As for their email response, I can say that is the worst email customer service I ever encountered. Normal company takes max 2 days to respond, they have to take 5-7 days. There was one time I immediately send my email within 1 min after I received a response from ezbuy, as I was aware of their inattentive. However, despite my instant reply, I had to wait for few days for them to answer my simple question, which is regarding miscalculation of amount (if you do not double check the amount especially amount after conversion, you may lose some money). Calling them can be even worse, the staff is not informative, and not responsive. I have no where to get a satisfied customer experience from this agent. Email, call, online chat, none of them help.If you don't believe me, you can try to use taobao direct buy and you can see the total price including international shipping before you checkout, and then you compare with the price that you pay to ezbuy.Lastly, they have really bad management in terms of warehouse and their affiliates. There was one time I checked with them about my parcel, later they told me it was just arrived in their warehouse in KL and they would arrange a delivery to my house ASAP. After 2 days, I didn't receive my parcel so I checked with them again, this time they told me the parcel JUST arrived their warehouse and they will arrange a delivery to my house ASAP. WTF the stories are the same, 2 days passed and the parcel was still JUST ARRIVED. I could not hold myself but to scold them WTF last 2 days I checked you told me it was arrived, then no response from them anymore. I tirelessly checked with them again, then this time they told me they would prioritize the parcel, but no apology, no sincere, nothing.Think twice if you want to use this agent."

jiayi0528,"  Aug 2 2016, 04:46 PM",Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 78,Joined: Feb 2013,,"Dear All, just a sharing of a terribly bad experience I have with EZBuy Malaysia too. Before this I had a few purchases from them and the experiences are from good to average. However, the most recent parcel I received from them is the MOST FRUSTRATING AND THE WORST experience I ever had for online shopping. I ordered a pair of 30kg dumbbell in late June 2016 and I select the option of self collection. On 26 July 2016, I received sms from EZBuy that the parcel is finally arrived and I collected the parcel on 27 July at McD Prima Saujana. The item I received is not as description (the dumbbell only come with 3 x 2.5kg weight plate which is definitely far from the description of 30kg) and I called to their customer service (Mandy) on the above matter and also sent them an email to seek for a solution on this matter. Even though I am not happy with it but I am still able to tolerate with this as I understand that human tend to have mistakes.Now the worst thing, on 28 July 2016, I received a call from PosLaju Malaysia informing me I have a parcel with them sent from Cheras to an address at Prima Saujana but they are unable to deliver as the address is incomplete and request me to self collect from their Bangi branch. At first I thought that it is a scam call and I did not ask much about it. After I got home I got curious what it might be and started to have a bad feeling about it that it might be the remaining weight plates of my dumbbell, so I search for EZBuy address and realise that their office is actually located at Taman Maluri Cheras and it further convinced me that it is my remaining weight plates. It then took me more than 20 calls to trace back the number that called me to get the tracking number of the parcel and another 2 hours to collect the parcel on the next day.    How can EZBuy be so IRRESPONSIBLE and send out a parcel which I already indicated in my remarks by self collection? And the worse thing, send to an address which I do not know how they get it. Before this I had a few parcels from EZBuy which were sent directly to my house and they definitely have the record of my address, even if they don't, they have my contact number to confirm on what address to send to. Why the hell are they sending it to a McD!? I AM EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED AND PISSED OFF BY THIS!!!    And the name!! They put my name as my Login ID!! Which I need to explain to the PosLaju officer during the collection. They are lucky as I take up the initiative to trace back the parcel and my Login ID is actually the combination of my name and birthday. What are they going to do if the parcel is no where to trace or I am unable to collect the parcel? Are they going to do full refund?After collection of the 2nd parcel of the dumbbell, the item is still different from the description. The weight plate is different from their description but I do not intend to look into this matter as long as the weight is as per my order which is 30kg. Unfortunately, the item is still short of 1 x 2.5kg plate after all the hassle. I email to them again to complaint about this but to date do not have any response from them yet. I do not have the intention to bad mouth about any one here but this is just a sharing of experience I had with them so others will take note on this before order anything from them. Actually I even started to get impatient with them even before i received the parcel, but if i tell all the grandmother's story here it will be few pages long. Of course, before this parcel I do have some good experiences with them as well but this 1 will definitely make me think twice before I order anything else with them again. Thought i can make use of their Prime membership to set up my home gym in the future, but they have failed the test even for just a pair of dumbbell."

First of all, I tracked my items which already arrived at the warehouse, & was wondering why the status in Ezbuy is still under ""not reached"". So I tried talked to the customer service via FB messenger, and guess, the customer service told me, we need 5-7 days to update the system! So, my question to the customer service, so which means my things will be staying in your warehouse for a week without I can proceeding any further? And, IF my items lost in somewhere, I can only being notify after a week? So the lead time stated in the page is 5days which is even shorter than the warehouse take to update the system?So ridiculous for the service. I have been using other forwarder for many times, usually they will update latest after a week n then i can just proceed to ship it back. I try Ezbuy just because I saw them frequently pop out in my FB wall. Well after I make noise for 3days which the system still blank! Finally the 5th day it was updated! So I quickly proceed for delivery, and again it took me 2 days to arrange... another day to ship.... and I use priority air, which means is 3-5 working days as per mentioned. but after 3days, still I couldn't check on the status. The tracking status is still ""sorry, no information on this shipment"". Can anyone tell me after how many days of shipment only you guys get to track your parcel? I would says, the whole process before ship already took up to a week for me to settle... and another 1 week for shipment (hopefully it is a week, dare not imagine if it will takes more than a week... )Well, I can confirm, the really spent a lot on marketing! I would rather opt for any small forwarder, they are much efficient and have much better customer service! Oh, and their price are relatively quite competitive too! Certain forwarder, their sender will even send me at 9pm to my doorstep! Text me before they are coming to ensure I'm home.... Ezbuy, sh** forwarder ever!"

I went through them to make a purchase on 2nd Nov for some party favours for a kid's party on first week Dec.. And the confirmation was made only on the 7th after they asked for payment which was made on 3rd, and went through all the back and forth. I had also stated that this is quite urgent as we need it as soon as possible. On 23rd, they claimed that the shipment just left Guangzhou, of course we already got a nasty surprise as we had made several calls on the same week to ask for the estimated arrival date and was advised that it was arriving already! That is not the worst part, since 27th we started checking on the delivery schedule as there was a message in my account stated that the parcel was out for delivery. However none of the customer service officers could tell me when it will be delivered. On 30th, we called again and they claimed they could not contact the delivery man and thus could not check and unsure the whereabout of my parcel. Today we had to chase for the delivery man who was out and about town in Kuala Lumpur to retrieve our parcel!! This is ridiculous and unprofessional. We had paid rm170 just for shipping. This was already too expensive in my previous experiences shopping directly with 65daigou which is now Ezbuy Singapore or Taobao in Singapore. And I did not experience any incidents like this in my years of shopping online too. Talking about professionalism, Ez buy MY should not continue in this market if they cannot handle simple customer service.. or is not serious about running the business. This is my first time writing a negative review as I always think there should be a second chance given. The Singapore counter part is quite sloppy and slow, but still deliver its promise. I seriously think that the Ez Buy My management is not doing checks on the way the business is managed. Nor do they addressed the underlying issues. DO NOT use Ez Buy My service unless you have lots of time and spare cash to waste and like to make calls to check on them and do car chase with their driver. Talking about retail therapy??"

There also could be delay in custom check in China before boarding. After it arrived in klia, another check going to happen. After everything cleared, then only can release to distribution center. If it fall on a public holiday, further delays. I do suggest buyer lower their expectation when it comes to these slow mail delivery.

You're not buying from DG65. They are helping you to buy the item from Taobao. So you pay them, they pay the seller. Not sure how their system works, but if they have to verify receive your payment then only proceed, wasted some time. After placing orders, have to wait sellers to ship to forwarding warehouse. Then they will scanned those parcels and repackaged them according to the orders. Items then be sent to custom for declaration and checks. Then only board ship and route to MY. It does take some time. That's why I encourage buyers to deal with Taobao directly. Buy with forwarding option, then pay via online banking. You can track each shipment from each seller. You can even negotiate changing colors, items in case he ran out of stock. You can also opt for refund. Then when all the items arrived in warehouse, can proceed with international forwarding. If you are urgent, you can also ship partially and leave those not urgent items for later shipment. Items arrived in warehouse can be stored there FOC up to 14days upon arrival."

If you can find your item tracking no and the forwarder warehouse, then you can contact them to track the item, then pay them via Taobao, and they will shipped to you right away."

It's their forwarding service. I purchase my items in American stores and they ship to their us warehouse address. FedEx tracking confirms that my items have arrived at ezbuy us warehouse on the 26th nov. Up to today (it's almost Christmas!), ezbuy have yet to update the items that have reached their warehouse into their system. Without their update I am unable to ship it back. What's worst is I have another set of item that's also waiting to be consolidated before I can ship them back here to Malaysia together. It's been in their storage (not my fault- they took forever to update) for almost 30 days now. They gonna start charging me for storage already ! Walau I've even tried contacting them on fb and the inconsiderate ppl don't even bother to reply to help... almost a month already guys..... unbelievable... I even resort to begging them..! Begging them to help me. Beg them to update so I can bloody click on the ship it back option! What the hell man... and yet they still don't bother to help. the worst experience ever. If you're reading this ezbuy please help la aiyo just do ur job.... my Christmas presents won't arrive d this year..."

y_ky,"  Dec 31 2016, 02:32 PM",New Member,Group: New Member,Posts: 0,Joined: Oct 2012,,"So this is gonna be a little long post, so apologies for that.After using Ezbuy's service so many times, I'd rate them between ""satisfied"" to ""yeah okay, got the work done at least"". BUT! Discover some absurd policy about their shipping this time! I ordered some plastic storage box weighing up to 5KG volumetric weight. So thinking since I'm charged volumetric might as well order something else to take advantage of the extra space (if any) since I'm charged for it anyway. And it's storage box, just put some stuff in there la right? But LO AND BEHOLD! After ordering other stuff: 11 pcs clothing; 1 heels, 1 flats; and one bag, quoted weight shoot up to 9.32 kg, chargeable weight 10.26kg. Heels got charged .72 volumetric weight, fine cause comes with box. Strapless bar  .59kg due to boxed packaging as well. So volumetric weight is about 6.5kg, remaining 3kg is for the clothes. But since my parcel is most probably being charged volumetric, and FFS the rest are clothes! So go ahead and fold it, crumple it, roll it! The actual weight shouldn't matter anymore, right? So I contacted customer service wanted to tell them give me a final quote of the consolidated parcel's volumetric weight, to my surprise I was told regardless of the volumetric weight, ANYTHING THAT GOES INTO THE SAME PARCEL WILL BE CHARGED ADDITIONAL SHIPPING. Like, WTF are you talking? Since when shipping company charge you the weight for every item inside the box after deciding to charge you on volumetric weight? Or am I missing something? Tried to ask them repack my heels inside the storage box to reduce volume, was told I will still be charged for the heels DESPITE NOT TAKING ANY EXTRA SPACE OTHER THAN SPACE IN STORAGE BOX! I'm seriously mind-blown. My mistake for not clarifying with them beforehand but who would have thought they'd be so ridiculous? Definitely not me! Or maybe I didn't understand shipping logics/rules, so someone enlighten me yeah. Don't   if I'm wrong  Conversation with CS attached!And it took me days to be able to get someone to assist me. No one ever give a damn about message dropped via their app. Website stated live chat from 10-10 Mon-Thurs, good for office time employees right? No. I tried to speak to them online Thurs around 8PM but live chat NOWHERE TO BE FOUND - they disabled it. Friday had to use my phone to go online during lunch hour for the live chat - hell of a challenge. Mobile website is not that user-friendly.

Taobao direct forwarder only charge rmb19 per 1kg (rm13), u can keep 20days at thier warehouse to combined all your product. I normally buy clothes so they will jus put every pakage from different seller into 1 big plastic bag. Usually reach KL (Me) after 3 days from guangzhou.

What made me think twice before proceeding my order with them is because they don't quote you the actual total which is only the amount excluding the shipping fees as its very risky for us, it could be up to them on the shipping fees after paying the product cost.
