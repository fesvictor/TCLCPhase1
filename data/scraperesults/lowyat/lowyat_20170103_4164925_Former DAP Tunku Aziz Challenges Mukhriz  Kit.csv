It is a quid pro quo, 'if my son becomes prime minister then we will agree to you (Lim) become Deputy Prime minister,"" he claimed.He added DAP and PPBM were denying the allegation as the Malay community would baulk at the idea of Lim becoming deputy prime minister.""The essence of the whole issue rests on the fact there is a hidden agenda. DAP cannot go alone and therefore it needs Malay support.""Malay support will be withheld if the Malays are told clearly if [Lim Kit Siang] is going to be DPM if Pakatan wins next elections,"" Tunku Aziz added.http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...h.lbR5GwKi.dpuf"
