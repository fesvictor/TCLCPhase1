The Culture and Tourism Minister said this when asked whether the Prime Minister was the main reason why the event was cancelled.  Denying this, Nazri said Najib even thanked him for attempting to come to his defence against the attacks thrown by Dr Mahathir.  “I had the opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister two weeks ago when he came to Parliament. He thanked me as I was willing to engage in a debate to defend him,” he told reporters at the Parliament media centre here, Monday.  He added that Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi was supportive of the debate.  “This issue was never raised in Cabinet meetings so I don’t think there’s any problem. I think the ones who have a problem here are the police,” he said.  Asked if he needed to do his homework if the debate took place, Nazri said he need not do so.  “Have you seen Mahathir debating lately? He’s incoherent. This is easy for me. You’ve seen me debating in Parliament so I have nothing to worry about,” he said. Police had initially given their approval for the April 7 debate between Dr Mahathir and Nazri on Friday but revoked the permit the next day.  This came after Perak police also denied a permit for the same debate planned on March 25 in Kuala Kangsar.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017..._medium=twitter"
