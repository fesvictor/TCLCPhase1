You are not a politician,” he said.He asked Dzulkifli what had happened to all the reports he lodged with MACC against prime minister Najib Razak, his wife Rosmah Mansor, businessman Jho Low, Najib’s stepson Riza Aziz and the board of directors of state investment fund 1MDB in 2014.“Has MACC called these people up for investigation? What action has been taken against them?“Please don’t talk big like a politician. Your duty is to investigate and then act against all those who practise corruption without favouritism.”On a another matter, Khairuddin urged Felda settlers not to be fooled by the government under Najib which was offering them “sweets” now and until polling day for the 14th general election.He said that if Najib was sincere in wishing to ease the sufferings of Malaysians, he should extend the RM5,000 he offered to each Felda settler’s family to all Malaysians.However, he said, Najib preferred to play politics by helping only the Felda settlers to protect Umno’s traditional seats in Felda settlements."
