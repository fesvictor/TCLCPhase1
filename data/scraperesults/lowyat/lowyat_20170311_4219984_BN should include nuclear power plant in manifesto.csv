Whether we go nuclear cannot be left to site-specific environmental impact assessment only because any nuclear fallout is likely going to engulf the entire peninsula, Singapore and South Thailand.In any event, the current government cannot be entrusted with managing nuclear power. You just have to see how they have special visas that had allowed North Korean spies to freely use Malaysia for their intelligence and procurement activities.It's obvious that they are trying to sneak this through in the midst of the Act 355 debacle and tensions with North Korea.Dr Spin: Are you ready, Minister in the PM’s Department Nancy Shukri? Have you studied the downsides as well as the claimed benefits from the industry lobbyists?Is there overwhelming trust in the government and its regulatory agencies? Are the Malaysian economy, political structure and anti-corruption record robust enough to ensure that a nuclear project is completely clear of corrupting influences?Has Malaysia demonstrated the openness necessary to ensure that every incident and failure is objectively and thoroughly examined to maintain required quality standards and management integrity?Are you really ready or just apparently another fool?CucuMalaysia: What other countries have, Malaysia must also have, at all costs even if it is of poor quality. That's the mentality of Umno cabinet members.The country already possesses submarines that allegedly don't submerge, fighter planes without engines, poorly-constructed buildings that may collapse anytime, poor urban traffic schemes, and the list goes on.And not forgetting, we also have an astronaut. What else do other countries have which we still don't have?The Analyser: BN should try including a nuclear power plant in their election strategy for GE14. That should give you a good idea of what Malaysians think of the plan.This sounds like it is a fait accompli after zero community consultation.Ex-PJ: The nuclear plant will be supplied and managed/run by China. Ex-RMAF radar operators need not apply."
