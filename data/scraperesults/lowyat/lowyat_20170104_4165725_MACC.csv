MACC deputy chief commissioner (operations) Datuk Azam Baki said a total of 982 investigation papers were opened, 932 individuals were arrested and 258 were charged as of Dec 15, last year.“We managed to address public interests issues and solve high profile cases like the bauxite mining in Pahang.In October, MACC seized RM52 million cash and froze another RM60 million in bank accounts following the arrests of two senior Sabah Water Department officials. The commission also seized 9 luxury vehicles, 94 handbags, and an assortment of jewellery and watches. Prior to that, the MACC had, on March 21, charged former Youth and Sports Ministry senior officer Otman Arshad, 57, with 32 counts of corruption involving RM38.5 million in federal funds."
