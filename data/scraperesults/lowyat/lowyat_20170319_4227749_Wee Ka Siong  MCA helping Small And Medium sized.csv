They must be brave in changing their mindset to adapt to it,” he addedAt the dialogue, Dr Wee said that many SMEs had voiced their concern on their inability to hire foreign workers.“Muar is well known for its manufacturing sector, especially in the furnishing industry where they export their products to 160 countries.“They have paid the levy but the foreign workers have yet to arrive. I will forward their complaints to the relevant authorities,” he said.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...q3MrqSG4thZT.99"
