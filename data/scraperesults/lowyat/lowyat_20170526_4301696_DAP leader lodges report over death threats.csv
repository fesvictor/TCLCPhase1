The culture of thuggish politics, slander, and violent intimidation only worsens the poor conditions in our country.“Such bad culture should be put to a stop,” he said, while expressing hope that the law would be upheld...For the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year (full news access)or RM420 a year (full news + full archive access).

joe_mamak,20170526,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,I think he was referring to the allegations that DAP was the one behind it.

joe_mamak,20170526,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,I think that poster is not from DAP or Edry.  It is from the anti-DAP facebook page.  The picture has since been removed.  Did he say that?  I don't know.  A google search returned this - https://www.roketkini.com/2017/05/23/13-mei...ah-pilihanraya/
