The three are Datuk Iskandar Samad, Datuk Ahmad Yunus Hairi and Zaidy Abdul Talib.Fate in the balance: (from left) Iskandar, Ahmad Yunus and Zaidy. A PAS insider said the meeting did not discuss what the party would do if it exits the state government.“There are many options but it is up to the people to interpret,” said the insider.If the PAS threat materialises, the new state Opposition will comprise 13 from PAS, 11 from Umno and two Independents.There is speculation that former Mentri Besar Tan Sri Khalid Ibrahim is positioning himself to make a return and he is said to be eyeing some crossovers from the other side to make up the numbers.Ironically, the PKR political bureau was also meeting on the other side of town at the same time on Tuesday. That meeting, chaired by its president Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, decided to order all its political appointees in Kelantan to step down with immediate effect.On calls for PAS to be axed from the Selangor government, she said it would be decided together with Azmin who is on a working trip to Brussels.The pressure on Azmin, who is also PKR deputy president, to act against PAS is growing with several DAP leaders urging him to drop PAS from his administration.There is also pressure from within PKR which is convening its national congress this weekend. The PAS Syura Council statement criticising PKR for not supporting the PAS Islamic agenda has also riled PKR members.According to Kelantan deputy Mentri Besar Datuk Mohd Amar Nik Abdullah, PKR has about 100 political appointees holding posts as municipal councillors, constituency coordinators, penghulu and GLC board members. Guchil assemblyman Mohd Roslan Puteh is the lone PKR elected representative in Kelantan.Mohd Amar said the Kelantan government would not force the PKR appointees to resign and that it was up to them to decide.The PKR move is seen as forcing the hand of PAS in Selangor. However, PAS has refused to budge from the Selangor government on the grounds that it is there based on the mandate won in the 2013 general election.This the second time that Selangor is battling a political crisis from within. The state government was shaken to the core two years ago when DAP and PKR ganged up to oust Khalid as Mentri Besar.His exit almost resulted in a constitutional crisis as the DAP-led camp in Pakatan and the palace engaged in a tug-of-war over who should be the next mentri besar."

We did not come out with any such order,” he said in a press conference today, referring to PAS’ 13 state assemblymen.Tuan Ibrahim explained that any further decision on the fate of the state assemblymen and three PAS executive councillors was up to Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Azmin Ali and the Sultan.Party secretary general Datuk Takiyuddin Hassan explained that this was based on the Selangor constitution, claiming that any decision depends on the Sultan’s consent.“The question of resigning doesn’t arise and our excos are holding on this clause until there’s a decision from the Sultan,” he said.The Kota Baru MP added that even PKR itself has not made decision and is waiting for Azmin’s return from overseas to take the next course of action.“PKR itself didn’t make a decision. They are also waiting for the Mentri Besar’s (decision).“MB has to ask the consent from the Sultan. We will leave it to Tuanku. We will cross the bridge when we get there,” Takiyuddin explained.Pakatan Harapan has 29 assemblymen in the 56-seat Selangor state legislative assembly — DAP (14), PKR (13) and Parti Amanah Negara (two). PAS has 13 and Umno 12, while there are two independents in the state.PKR on Tuesday ordered all its representatives in Kelantan to resign from their positions in the state’s local councils after PAS severed ties with them.PAS’ ultimate decision-making Syura Council formally sealed the proposal to sever ties with PKR on May 11, which then cast a scrutiny on its party’s representatives in the PKR-led Selangor government.Currently, three PAS leaders hold state executive council positions in Selangor, alongside PKR and DAP members.The PAS trio — Datuk Iskandar Samad, Datuk Dr Ahmad Yunus Hairi, and Zaidy Abdul Talib — asserted that they would like to serve out their appointments as mandated, for the full term, which will expire in June next year."

It just not fair to those voters that votes for PR, not PH. Wait till next GE which might happen in less than a year."
