I can make more profit than the continuous losses (by St Regis Langkawi),""Rafizi said it made zero revenues for 2015 and made a net loss of RM2.7 million in 2015, and a net loss of RM3.7 million in 2014.Rafizi said it raises the question on whether they can generate enough income to pay off their loans and debts,"" he added.Firstly you bodoh. Ground-breaking means START OF CONSTRUCTION - not start of business. It is normal for investments to make losses during the construction phase since it generates ZERO revenues but still have costs.The hotel only opened in April 2016 and has had a great reception and good occupancy rates.In 2004, Airlines had been complaining that there was not enough hotel rooms in Langkawi and had hoped for hotel rooms to be doubled - saying that demand drastically outstrips supply.Hotels in Langkawi recorded occupancy rates of 75% to 95% in 1Q2016. “Langkawi, one of the hotel markets with the highest average daily rate (ADR) in the country, is expected to continue performing well with the recent opening of the St Regis hotel, It has completely changed the high-end luxury travel for Langkawi” says The Edge.A report by UPM also said that Langkawi stands to lose out on a major potential source of revenue  if there was no focus on the high-net-worth individuals marketThis is why the Lembaga Pembangunan Langkawi (LADA) dan Aset Tanah Nasional Bhd decided to partner with Peter Sondakh, who owns the St Regis Hotels in Bali and Jakarta to quickly develop this hotel in Langkawi.One of only 30 Starwoods group resort hotels in the world, St Regis had already won multiple coveted international property awards 2016-2017.It  was honoured with two awards, the ‘Best Hotel Interior Asia Pacific’ and ‘Best International Hotel Interior’ and is also the proud recipient of the Condé Nast 2017 Award for Excellence – Best for Families.On Tripadvisor, the hotel also has an excellent 4.5 stars out of 5 rating out of 211 reviews.Yes, the hotel has been wildly successful after opening in drawing high-end tourists - not to mention the money that these high-end tourists spend while traveling to Malaysia.Tourism has boomed last year 2016 and will continue to boom this year as the govt continues to do more to promote and develop our tourism industry - which is the second largest industry after manufacturing.And yet, we have absolute idiots like Rafizi who continues to attack every single project while sabotaging our economy just to incite hate everyday.Everyone must remember that Rafizi has already admitted that his job is to menghasut rakyat tiap-tiap hari.And this is what he is doing again today even though it makes him look like a complete fool."

What's his problem? __Rafizi said ""Umno cybertroopers"" would likely brush off his concerns by stating that the hotel is not yet fully operational.""But even if St Regis Langkawi is not fully operational, it raises the question on whether they can generate enough income to pay off their loans and debts,"" he added."

joe_mamak,20170314,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Oh, I am sure he understands.   You understand the big sum of money thrown into this business investment, when there are so many cuts at various ministries in the budget?"
PappyBoyington,20170314,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"For years, you lot wanted govt to improve efficiency and cut wastage to reign in govt spending and now you are complaining of cuts? So do prefer to have Fed Govt spending to go up 5-fold since 2008, like Penang? All funded through selling of assets?Raising assessment rates and water rates 3 times in 8 years?BTW - Malaysia is 8th most efficient as calculated by WEF
Also, please don't divert - if you say Lapiji understands then why he still say something stupid like that?To lie to the public or take advantage of Pakatan's gullible supporters?"
joe_mamak,20170314,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Wow.  I am talking about cuts to various ministries and you are talking about efficiency and wastage.   Our government not much money lah. Hence the cuts.  So, don't make it out to be so noble that it is for efficiency and reducing wastage."
PappyBoyington,20170314,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"Why do companies do budget cuts?To do the same work with less budget = higher efficiency.So what do you understand by efficiency? How do you define efficency?Also, please don't change the subject - if you say Lapiji understands then why he still say something stupid like that?To lie to the public or take advantage of Pakatan's gullible supporters?"
joe_mamak,20170314,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"LOL  You stop diverting with your efficiency talk lah.  Like those cuts to critical ministries such as health, education, etc. etc.  Is it because of inefficiencies?  Yeah, right."
PappyBoyington,20170314,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,Thread is about a politician lying thru his teeth. So you like having a politician use lies to hasut people and say stupid things?
joe_mamak,20170314,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Yes, I was pointing out why he is raising the issue about investments in these hotel mewah; when we are facing budget cuts.  The message the government is sending is times are tough, need to be careful with expenditure, need to tighten our belts, etc. etc.  And here the government goes investing into a hotel mewah.You try explaining this to those who are falling through the cracks........"
NoNameSake,20170314,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 30,201407,,"the main problem is that when the government have a lot of money they spend it like no tomorrow, and when come problems the rakyat have to pay for it, i doesn't care if the government want to implement GST and the money were spend for the benefit of the rakyat.but now, where have the billions of GST money have gone too? the government start cutting subsidies and education/medical funding and yet some department even have rising in funds. and your so called most efficient government in the world was from 2014, not the latest, that time GST was just implemeted. try to look around u, with the ringgit value declining our imports become more expensive and slowly it effects the rakyat. u can say all shopping complex and fast food restaurant are full of people, but u must know that if the rakyat doesn't spend their money our domestic market will fall and might create more problems than we are today. but that doesn't mean that the rakyat are rich and doesn't care about the economy."
PappyBoyington,20170314,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"No, Lapiji never said that in his PC. All he said was that the company was making losses (during construction period, duh) and he can make a profitable business.How would you know what Lapiji MEANT.. unless..Wait.. are you YB Rafizi?"

PappyBoyington,20170314,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"Frankly I think Lapiji is doing a Trump - which is to ensure he's in the headlines every week, doesn't matter if the stuff he says menghasut or outright lies or even really dumb things like accusing a company of not making money during construction stage.(any resemblance to persons alive or dead is purely coincidental)"
joe_mamak,20170314,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,You should know his day-to-day press conferences or blow-by-blow press conferences by now.  I think this is the second one.  PSNo need to go so low lah.  We are all adults here.
