Selangor is not only for the Malays but also for the Chinese and Indians, so the other component parties must also work hard towards regaining Selangor. The BN components must stay vigilant from now,” he said.He said this in his speech at the Hulu Langat Umno Division delegates conference here today which was also attended by Selangor Umno Liaison Committee chairman Tan Sri Noh Omar and Hulu Langat Umno Division chief Datuk Johan Abd Aziz.Ahmad Zahid said it was improper for the Selangor BN to allow the opposition to continue enjoying the benefits after they had put in all the hard work towards the development of the state.“The developments, foreign investments including job opportunities were made possible by Umno and BN long before they (the opposition) came into power... so how could they, after just two terms, say that they have contributed to 25 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product.“All along it was us who had reaped and sowed but the fruits of our labour are being enjoyed by others.“It is my promise that if we manage to win back the Hulu Langat parliamentary and state seats more provisions will be allocated here,” he said. — Bernamahttp://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...ngor-says-zahid"
