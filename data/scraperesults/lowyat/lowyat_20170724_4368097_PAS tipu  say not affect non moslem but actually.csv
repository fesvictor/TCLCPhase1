unknown warrior,20170724,12 Years Member /k/ ELDER,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 2,802",200507,,"http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...kota-bahru-run/PETALING JAYA: Politicians and social activists are up in arms over a directive by the Kota Bharu Municipal Council that male and female participants be segregated during a fun run held last week as this proved that non-Muslims were being affected by the supposedly Muslim-only rulings of Kelantan PAS .According to a report by The Star Online, Noor Farida Ariffin of the G25 group of eminent Malays said the directive was a clear indication of the growing conservatism in Kelantan.“Non-Muslims should protest the encroachment of their rights by the council,” she said, adding that this directive was one in many affecting non-Muslims.Last year, several businessmen were fined by the council for indecent advertising because they displayed posters with models not wearing headscarves.“Things are getting from bad to worse, and what the council has done is all about exercising their petty power,” Noor Farida was quoted by the news portal as saying.Meanwhile Kelantan MCA chief Hou Kok Chung said that rather than impose such a directive, the council should instead give more focus to improving racial harmony and the economy of the state.The 7km Run for Peace, organised by Buddhist group Soka Gakkai Malaysia has been held nationwide since 2015. However this year’s event came with a condition – that male and female participants be segregated.However despite the directive, most of the 1,400 participants defied the council and ran together.MCA Religious Harmony Bureau chairman Ti Lian Ker meanwhile was quoted by the news portal as saying, “The council’s political master gave assurances that this won’t affect non-Muslims, but when there is abuse or overextension of such regulations they keep quiet, so how can the public trust them?”Social activist Anas Zubedy when asked to comment on the ruling, pointed out that males and females were not even segregated when they performed the haj in Mecca.“If there is no segregation among males and females during the haj pilgrimage, which is very important for all Muslims, then I think it is something we should all ponder on,” he said."

MsGaijin,20170725,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200812,,"Well the way I see it, G25 and you pseudo-libtards are the jokers indeed~ can't even differentiate RUU355 with segregation between female & male in a public event which require permission from the municipal council (dafuq with private encroachment?). So what are the punishments under RUU355 or the State Syariah Criminal Enactment for the Nons if they violated the directive? The State Govt ensured that the State Syariah Criminal Enactment will not be imposed on the Nons, so can anyone provide me the answer I've been asking for so many years - Has there been a case where a Non-Muslim convicted under the State Syariah Criminal Enactment which is granted under the existing RUU355? A municipal directive for a public event held in their jurisdiction is as valid as their other municipal directives such as Jawi signage~Keep on laughing at yourself~ lawak mia pseudo-libtards."

YellowKingValley,20170725,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 398,201412,,"You asked us to support RUU355 based on the premise that you do not impose your religious culture on us.You say this is council laws not syariah? Inb4 later non-Muslim females are forced to wear tudung under guise of council laws, non-Muslim males circumsized cuz national health law, non-Muslim kids must attend quran classes because national curriculum."

Didn't see G25 and pseudo-libtards making a hoo-haa about it~At least, TGHH made a promise that punishments under RUU355 will not affect the Nons, unlike some biblical laws being imposed on all a.k.a S377 of the PC~Unless our Penal Code is amended to include hudud punishments upon obtaining the required majority votes in the Parliament"
