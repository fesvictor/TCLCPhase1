PAS is cooking up something and I am not sure how everything will be unfold. Once Najib is gone, I can see the upcoming leaders in UMNO might be even more friendlier to PAS. If UMNO decided to get in line with PAS agenda, who knows maybe the two parties will merge and we will find ourselves in a very bad sectarian political scenario in the future.In politics, there's no such thing as permanent enemies. The only thing that unite these political whores is their mutual interests."

Cakap tui.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2010...erent-approach/Separate checkout counters separate queue in shopping centers this one haram that one haram. Clothes must wear like this cannot be like that. Concert also must protest. Elton John concert protest because gay. Selena Gomez concert protest because too not gay. On top of that they haven't done anything progressive. Like ever. Solution to every problem is hudud and sharia.  If this is not backward mentality then I don't know what is.Edit : Protest against opening cinema also got even though the cinema will be with lights on and segregated seating plus must close for one month during Ramadan. Really ah bro you don't agree they are Taliban of malaysia? https://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnists/2...2/cinema-please

Owh lupa RBA ni perangai serupa manusia mentioned by Goebbels. Well your enemies also can learn how to imitate your ways and adapt~
