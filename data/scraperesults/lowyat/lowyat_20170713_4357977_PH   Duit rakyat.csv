Unlike bn, najib changed the ag, sprm. Kpn? Dont bother.Someone just called another person bodo and pointed out that 8 years corrupt is no better than 50years corrupt and we shud maintain the 50years one. Without realizing the shits coming out his own brainAs we dont like all this open house wastage, let it be heard. Use the budget for sustainability instead. What is so difficult to curb wastage and corruptions? You only need common sense, well for me at least.  Its amusing and fascinating when someone who are clever enuf to use a forum totally missing the point of a posting."

Or you are even dumber for not being able to?Ph is corrupt is someones accusition, im just playing along comparing 8yrs vs 50yrs. If theres a proof of corruption go ahead and make a report. And, theres still chance to eliminate corruption if theres any and repair all other party except BN. Its beyond repair. Do you missed my point again?If theres zero corrupt manifesto by any party, ill take that.Later in the back cry? U mean, NOW crying in the front?"

quadreduce,20170714,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 14,201206,,"How would i know? If im in charge of PH, i will abolish open house regardless tong2 gaji or duit rakyat. Since we are not in the party, what can we do then? Voice out and discuss in forums and social media.If that concerns u alot, go ask them. It does concern me and i dont go to any open house of any party."
