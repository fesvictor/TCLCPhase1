The Serdang PAS Youth wing has protested over a bikini photography contest scheduled in Bangi this month, claiming it goes against the values of the Malay-majority area.The wing has since urged state and federal authorities, including Islamic enforcers and the local council to block the event in Selangor in every possible way.“We see this program as clearly contrary to the life values of the majority-Malay-Muslim residents in Bangi, that is labelled Knowledge City, in addition to it not bringing any benefit to the locals,” the wing chief Rosli Jusoh said in a statement, carried by PAS portal HarakahDaily.The wing has expressed its dissatisfaction to the Tourism and Culture Ministry, the Selangor state government, the Selangor Islamic Religious Department, and the Kajang Municipal Council.It also urged all Muslim NGOs, mosque networks, student and youth groups around Bangi and Selangor to collectively protest the event.The photography contest is scheduled to be held on February 19 at a water theme park, the Bangi Wonderland.It is part of the Supermodel International Malaysia 2017 contest, and will feature its top 20 finalists. None of the finalists are Malay-Muslims.The photography contest is open to local and foreign contestants who need to pay RM198 each, and stand the chance to win a RM500 cash prize, trophy, or ticket to the grand final event of Supermodel International Malaysia 2017.Supermodel International Malaysia 2017 is co-organised by I Creative Event Sdn Bhd and Character International."

Why not PAS go to war against those who SMOKE in TOILETS which is an epidemic and cause much more harm in so many ways (besides the wrong place to do the wrong thing)

If these people can be easily sin, then its their eyes and brains are the problem not the woman. it is possible to see a woman, and not sin, it all depend on our mentality. If that person is not mature and easily tempted by syaitan then the problem is him, not the woman wear a bra. For this reason his eyes and brains are causing the sin, and he should throw it in the longkang and ban himself."
