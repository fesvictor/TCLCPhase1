Penang MCA chairman Datuk Tan Teik Cheng was also present.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...g23Ag6uDbFW8.99"

Kaerna,20170801,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 282,200802,,A chance? Merdeka to 2008 tu apa?But to be fair during Mahathir time chinese were kept satisfied. Last time people were proud to be associated with MCA and they were filled with capable and dedicated members. Then after this Chua CD tookover he start to keep more wealth to himself and his cronies and thus angering a lot of grassroot members resulting in a lot of them leaving MCA..Now what's left of MCA are connected  opportunistic cronies and their families who still hanging on to any networking with government left for wealth.
