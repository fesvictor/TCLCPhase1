Mikken,20170406,#,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,056",200803,,"DEWAN Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Pandikar Amin Mulia decided to defer the debate on PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang’s Bill to the next meeting in July, to much protest from the floor.Pandikar Amin, however, overrode all protests, saying he was exercising the power vested in him in making the ruling.He went on to share a saying he had heard.“If you are in power, you are powerful. If you don’t use your powers, you are a bloody fool.“Today, I am free to manage the proceedings. And I will use my discretion as the Speaker to defer the debate to the next Parliamentary meeting,” he said.Earlier, he expressed his elation that he was not bound by Standing Order 15 to conduct proceedings.Standing Order 15 states that Government business shall have precedence over private member’s business.“First, I am happy because for once I have full powers to manage the proceedings without any constrictions of Standing Order 15,” he said.Abdul Hadi, the Marang MP, was allowed to table amendments to the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act, also known as RUU355 and gave a 20-minute explanation on the reasons why he wanted to propose amendments to allow Syariah courts to impose stiffer penalties.Only Datuk Takiyuddin Hassan (PAS-Kota Baru) was allowed to debate in support of Abdul Hadi’s motion. He did so for almost two hours.Two MCA MPs interjected as Takiyuddin was speaking, voicing their concerns over the proposed amendments.Datuk Koh Nai Kwong (BN-Alor Gajah) asked if the proposed amendments were unconstitutional while Khoo Soo Seang (BN-Tebrau) was concerned over the element of hudud.Pandikar Amin said the explanations given by Abdul Hadi and Takiyuddin helped him have a clearer understanding of the proposed amendments.“I now understand RUU355 clearly. Before this, it was vague. After listening to them, I am now clear.”He then said he would defer debate to the next meeting, which is expected to start from July 24.There was chaos in the House when he made the announcement with several opposition MPs shouting at the Speaker for not allowing them to speak.Khalid Samad (Amanah-Shah Alam) questioned if the debates were only for Umno and PAS.Pandikar Amin had also ruled earlier that there was no need to get the consent from the Conference of Rulers as Abdul Hadi was merely proposing amendments to RUU355 and not introducing a new law.He said this in response to Gooi Hsiao Leung (PKR-Alor Setar) who asked about the lawsuit filed by Mohamed Tawfik Ismail against Pandikar Amin and Dewan Rakyat secretary Datuk Roosme Hamzah.“Amendments have been done a few times before and there is no need to get approval from the Conference of Rulers as the Act is already there (since 1965),” he said.He further explained that the rule of sub judice cannot impede Parliament from performing its function to enact laws, and there must be a clear separation of powers between the judiciary and legislature.The frustrated opposition MPs are now planning a mock Parliament debate on the Bill.Pandan PKR MP Rafizi Ramli said the mock Parliament would be held at a different location, and would be streamed live some time next week."

darthboyzzee,20170406,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"DAKWAAN LANGGAR PERLEMBAGAAN OLEH DAP SEKADAR DAKYAH KOSONGAKTA355 bukanlah suatu akta yang baru. Nama lainnya ialah AKTA MAHKAMAH SYARIAH (BIDANG KUASA JENAYAH) 1965 , pindaan 1984. Kerana itulah kita ada Mahkamah Syariah di setiap negeri dan seluruh negara pada hari ini. Akta 355 ini sudah diadakan sejak tahun 1965 lagi. Ketika itu Mahkamah Syariah telah diberi kuasa menghukum 6 bulan penjara, RM1,000 denda atau kedua dua sekali. Tiada siapa pernah mempertikaikan AKTA 355 sebagai melanggar perlembagaan Malaysia ketika itu walau negara sudah lama ada parti politik bukan Islam seperti DAP, MCA, GERAKAN atau MIC.Pada tahun 1984, AKTA355 dipinda memberi kuasa 3 tahun penjara, RM5,000 denda dan sebatan 6 kali. Pindaan ini dilakukan di Parlimen. Dibahaskan dan diluluskan di Parlimen. Seperti hari ini juga. Sekali lagi DAP dan parti bukan Islam yang lain tiada pula mempertikaikan pindaan ini, jauh sekali menyebut pindaan 'melanggar' Perlembagaan Malaysia. Pada tahun 1989, AKTA 355 dipinda lagi. Kali ini supaya diperluaskan ke Sabah dan Sarawak. Pindaan 1989 ini pun tiada pernah ada yg bangkitkan soal melanggar perlembagaan Malaysia. Rakyat Malaysia yang bukan Islam menghormati Mahkamah Syariah sebagai urusan agama Islam yang tidak pantas dicampuri bukan Islam. Anehnya bila AKTA 355 mahu dipinda pada tahun ini setelah pindaan kuasa hukuman kali terakhir dibuat pada tahun 1984, 32 tahun yang lalu, berbangkit bermacam macam dakwaan kononnya melanggar perlembagaan persekutuan. Padahal ia cuma soal menambah kuasa hukuman sahaja. Sama sahaja seperti berlaku pindaan tahun 1984.Umat Islam mempunyai sebab yang kuat untuk memperkasakan peranan Mahkamah Syariah. Ini kerana usaha pendidikan yang ada perlu seiring dengan undang undang yang tegas bagi menjaga kesejahteraan semua. Tempoh 1965 hingga 1984, masalah dan cabaran sosial dalam negara tidak sehebat hari ini. Hari ini Malaysia dicatat di peringkat dunia ditangga ke 8 industri pelacuran, ditangga ke 10 kadar penggunaan arak/alkohol, pusat perjudian tersohor, gejala amalan rasuah, korupsi. Masalah dalam masyarakat berkait runtuhnya rumahtangga oleh kadar perceraian yang membimbangkan, kadar kelahiran bayi luar nikah yang sangat tinggi, kadar kes buang bayi dan lain lain lagi. Kes penagihan dadah, bohsia, rempit sebahagian besarnya berakarumbi ketiadaan jiwa yg sejahtera oleh runtuhnya sistem hidup berkeluarga yang sempurna. Statistik yang ada menunjukkan umat Islam menyumbang peratus tertinggi dalam kebanyakan gejala negatif yang kronik ini. Umat Islam yang menjadi 65% dari rakyat Malaysia perlu kembali kepada undang undang yang ditentukan oleh ajaran Islam sebagai ubat terbaik memulihkan kualiti individu orang orang Islam. Kelihatan yang langgar perlembagaan bukan usul pindaan RUU355. TETAPI perbuatan menghalang umat Islam mematuhi syariat Islam itu sendirilah perbuatan melanggar perlembagaan. Ini kerana jika agama lain diberi kebebasan untuk diamalkan, mengapa menghalang diamalkan Islam oleh penganut Islam walhal Islam sudahpun menjadi agama bagi persekutuan. Beraninya segelintir bukan Islam mempertikai dan campur tangan urusan agama Islam adalah kerana adanya kalangan orang Islam sendiri yang mempertikaikan. Ia tidak akan berlaku begitu jika umat Islam bersatu. Tidak akan berlaku begitu jika tiada orang Islam yang jadi tali barut mereka yang anti Islam. Tidak jadi begitu jika orang Islam tidak terlalu obses sangat dengan sokongan politik bukan Islam kerana cita cita politik peribadinya. Perhatikan kandungan Perlembagaan Malaysia perkara 3.""Perkara 3. Agama bagi Persekutuan(1) Islam ialah agama bagi Persekutuan; tetapi agama-agama lain boleh diamalkan dengan aman dan damai di mana-mana Bahagian Persekutuan.(2) Di dalam tiap-tiap Negeri selain Negeri-Negeri yang tidak mempunyai Raja, kedudukan Raja sebagai Ketua agama Islam di Negerinya mengikut cara dan setakat yang diakui dan ditetapkan oleh Perlembagaan Negeri itu, dan, tertakluk kepada Perlembagaan itu, segala hak, keistimewaan, prerogatif dan kuasa yang dinikmati olehnya sebagai Ketua agama Islam, tidaklah tersentuh dan tercacat; tetapi dalam apa-apa perbuatan, amalan atau upacara yang berkenaan dengannya Majlis Raja-Raja telah bersetuju bahawa perbuatan, amalan atau upacara itu patut diperluas ke seluruh Persekutuan, setiap Raja lain hendaklah atas sifatnya sebagai Ketua agama Islam membenarkan Yang di-Pertuan Agong mewakilinya.(3) Perlembagaan-Perlembagaan Negeri Melaka, Pulau Pinang, Sabah dan Sarawak hendaklah masing-masing membuat peruntukan bagi memberi Yang di-Pertuan Agong kedudukan sebagai Ketua agama Islam di Negeri itu.(4) Tiada apa-apa jua dalam ini mengurangkan mana-mana peruntukan lain dalam Perlembagaan ini.(5) Walau apa pun apa-apa jua dalam Perlembagaan ini, Yang di-Pertuan Agong hendaklah menjadi Ketua Agama Islam di Wilayah-Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Labuan dan Putrajaya; dan bagi maksud ini Parlimen boleh melalui undang-undang membuat peruntukan-peruntukan bagi mengawal selia hal ehwal agama Islam dan bagi menubuhkan suatu Majlis untuk menasihati Yang di-Pertuan Agong mengenai perkara-perkara yang berhubungan dengan agama Islam""Pada saya, lebih 'gentleman' DAP membawa sahaja ke Mahkamah Tinggi bagi memperoleh jawapan sama ada dakwaan mereka bahawa RUU355 melanggar perlembagaan itu benar atau tidak. Kerana keputusan 2 kes iaitu saman parti GERAKAN terhadap EKJSII kelantan dan saman 4 individu Islam terhadap RUU355 ternyata tidak mendokong dakwaan DAP. Malah kes EJKS telah dibawa dari Mahkamah Tinggi ke Mahkamah Rayuan dan sehingga mahkamah yang paling tinggi sekali Mahkamah Persekutuan. Keputusannya adalah sama. Kepada seluruh umat Islam, jangan uzurkan diri dari menghadiri Perhimpunan Perpaduan Umat Islam Menyokong Memperkasakan Mahkamah Syariah H355 pada 18 Februari 2017 di Kuala Lumpur. Jika umat Islam Indonesia boleh berkumpul hingga 7 juta orang bagi memberi mesej solidariti ummah, kita patut malu jika kita gagal menyatukan suara juga sebegitu. HJ AHMAD AMZAD HASHIM 26hb Januari 2017"

One day if Sabah and Sarawak wants a full divorce then only they know. Lose their two states deposit and then truly paves the way for opposition parties.Current opposition parties very hard to focus because of Sabah and Sarawak. Just look how much inroads they have make not considering this both states last election. Anyway, Amanah being more secular than syariah will make the party more stable. Just look at Egypt. People wants stability. The rest are still sleeping with their black gold."

Ibrahimovic,20170406,*HolyHunk*,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,516",200708,From: Johor-Singapore,"I think alcohol drink is rotan. Fine up to 100k maybe on other offence? Cheating? But it would be interesting as it might lead to similar punishment like Aceh. If Muslim couple walk together can be rotan in public. But unlike one small province, the whole of Malaysia will dry it. I heard tourist like these kind of thing. Maybe good in PRC area like Danga Bay"

No united front even the  on something so significant it will most likely altered the country future permanently.I really wish that someone or some group will trully fight for our right as malaysian. Not because of who we were born to or whatever our belieif are.

Mikken,20170406,#,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,056",200803,,"Excepts from CFM Fact Sheet on Hudud Amendmenet Act 355:7. The current proposed amendments deal only with the increase in the existing punishments. It is proposed that the current maximum sentences of imprisonment for a period not exceeding 3 years, a fine not exceeding RM 5,000, or not more than 6 strokes of the cane, or a combination thereof, be increased to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 30 years, a fine not exceeding RM100,000, or not more than 100 strokes of the cane, or a combination thereof.8. “It is clear that while the proposed amendments to Act 355 again do not mention the word “hudud”, the fact is that the increase in the maximum punishments will allow for hudud-compliant punishments to be meted out. The proposed increase in the maximum penalties under the proposed amendments to Act 355 will allow several hudud punishments to be implemented directly, and for other hudud and non-hudud punishments to be indirectly achieved.”13. Additionally, a jail sentence of the maximum 30 years is greater than many of the punishments under the Penal Code. Under the Penal Code, a jail sentence of up to 30 years is imposed on those convicted of terrorist-related offences, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, for kidnapping and for hostage-taking. In countries where the death penalty is no longer applied, a sentence of 30 years in jail is seen as the equivalent of a death sentence. If implemented, the hudud-prescribed punishment for the hudud offence of apostasy would now be possible in principle.19. The maximum limits of a jail sentence and caning punishments under the proposed amendments exceed most punishments that currently exist under the Penal Code. When the focus was on the “inequality” that non-Muslims could not be prosecuted in the Syariah court (even in 1965), there were already calls for the law to apply equally to both Muslims and non-Muslims. Now that some of the punishments will exceed some of those under the Penal Code, there will be even greater calls in this regard21. An amendment such as those proposed to Act 355 have such grave consequences affecting the fundamental principles of justice, freedoms and rights of all Malaysians. As such, they must be thoroughly and responsibly discussed openly and honestly. This has not happened"
