ironmaid89,20170617,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"Ketua Pembangkang Datuk Seri Wan Azizah Ismail menuntut sidang tergempar parlimen diadakan segera.Ini susulan saman sivil pelucuthakan terbaru Jabatan Keadilan (DOJ), Amerika Syarikat (AS) bagi merampas aset-aset berkaitan 1MDB.“Mengadakan sidang tergempar di luar waktu persidangan Parlimen bukanlah amalan yang luar daripada kebiasaan.“Terutama sekali apabila isu yang dibincangkan itu melibatkan kepentingan rakyat dan negara,” kata Azizah.Beliau mengingatkan bahawa Malaysia pernah mengadakan sidang tergempar pada Julai 2014 bagi membincangkan insiden pesawat MH17 yang ditembak di Ukraine serta sidang khas mengenai Perjanjian Perkongsian Trans-Pasifik (TPPA) pada Januari 2016.Beliau menggesa perdana menteri mengemukakan usul itu kerana hanya Datuk Seri Najib Razak boleh berbuat demikian, berdasarkan peraturan dewan.“Maka dengan ini saya menggesa perdana menteri memanggil sidang tergempar parlimen segera yang mungkin bagi membincangkan dakwaan terbaru oleh DOJ.“Lantas dapat membersihkan nama negara dari sebarang cemuhan dan tohmahan,” katanya dalam kenyataan.Menyentuh langkah DOJ pada Khamis, beliau berkata isu itu telah menjadikan dana 1MDB mendapat perhatian dunia sekali lagi.“Tambah memeranjatkan apabila timbul dakwaan terbaru bahawa sebanyak RM17 bilion telah diseleweng oleh 'pegawai tertinggi negara' untuk membiayai kehidupan serba mewah,” katanya.Saman terbaru itu mendedahkan beberapa perkara termasuk bagaimana wang yang amat besar digunakan untuk membeli karya seni, hartanah, melabur dalam filem Hollywood, membeli kapal layar dan rantai berserta loket berlian bernilai puluhan juta dolar.Peguam Negara (AG) Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali membidas DOJ atas ""sindiran"" terhadap perdana menteri dalam saman itu.Menteri Komunikasi dan Multimedia Datuk Seri Dr Salleh Said Keruak pula mengutuk keras tindakan pembangkang yang menurutnya sanggup mengetepikan kedaulatan negara apabila menggunakan kuasa asing untuk mencampuri urusan politik negara.Beliau mendakwa mereka sanggup memanipulasi saman sivil DOJ sebagai senjata politik semata-mata untuk menjatuhkan pemimpin negara dan menjayakan matlamat peribadi.http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/385889"

darthboyzzee,20170617,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"10.  Unlike in the past, the financial markets did not react to the news of this DOJ suit. Neither are many MalaysiansThe Ringgit did not weaken substantially and the stock market did not drop.In fact, the Bursa stock market went up today despite the news. It continued its rally as Malaysia's economy continues to perform well and our prospects continue to brighten. Investors continue to believe in the transformation agenda under Prime Minister Najib.Unlike in the past, Malaysians now seem indifferent to the DOJ-1MDB newsAs Uber-Blogger Rocky Bru observed today:""It's been a year since the US Department of Justice made that explosive lawsuit announcement involving 1MDB. Since then, the Americans have elected a new President, Dr Mahathir Mohamad has confirmed his desire to be Prime Minister of Malaysia once again, and the DOJ's lawsuit hasn't moved an inch. The department's latest ""action"" has similar elements and juicy bits that featured in its ""action"" of last July's. So why aren't Malaysians not debating it like they did last July? I belong to several dozens of WhatsApp groups but only one is discussing the DOJ's action and by ""discussing"" I mean one individual has been providing all the links to DOJ news that might be spun against PM Najib Razak. Does that mean we are immune to news involving alleged corruption and stealing of billions from our coffers? Or are Malaysians generally not buying what the DOJ's claiming, especially since nothing has come out of their last action?""Soso1. It is still a civil suit for forfeiture of assets and not a criminal suit.Nothing has changed since last year except that more assets are listed. It is also important to note that civil asset forfeiture lawsuits are filed against the assets themselves and not individuals (such as Jhow Low etc). Owners of the assets can contest the forfeiture, which they are doing.Soso"

What will people think of their justice system??Meanwhile, we here in Malaysia are concern because the issue is related to us. Our Public fund."
