Actually I'm thinking that most people are critical of him simply because he's in an Islamist party and yet using his wealth (whether it is legitimate or not) frivolously. People who don't know him might be thinking, 'how many orphanages have you built?', 'how many charities are you supporting?', 'what have you done for your constituents?' and so on.After all, there is a perception that religious people should live moderately. This is especially when the person concerned is in a political party that shouts all day and all night about religious matters."

If one is religious, got money, give to charity. Same as we will question monks, nuns, pastors, priests, religious leader(even if not full time) if they live too lavishly.Other MPs/ADUNs are questioned also, they answer, they declare assets.If this guy not elected rep, nobody cares. SInce he is elected rep, he is answerable.Give you example of how NON muslim, NON Islamic party answer :A couple of years ago,Tian Chua was questioned on how come he could buy a Merz S class, where he got the money from. Accusation by MCA or Gerakan, forgot who. Tian Chua produced documents on the cost of the car, the loan he took to show he could afford to buy it on his MP salary(loan of RM1,000+ per month). It was a 2nd hand E class car.He further told the MCA/Gerakan guy to cease talking about that subject or he will sue for defamation.http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/176257Kan dah jelas macam tu, ini pulak jawab ""kalau aku nak beli lori, kapal terbang itu hak aku"" Rakyat bayar gaji dia sekarang/"

So many troubled/poor people in the world. They see people suffering, cannot tahan, donate to help. They have money, they give away, use old2 car. Or buy car give away. And this is non muslim, the standard we expect.If they live lavishly, big mansion that cost millions, luxury car, we will question kaw2.He is elected MP, dia kena perjelaskan supaya 110% jelas dia tak songlap.Orang lain yg kene persoal boleh jawab dgn bukti, kenapa dia ni besar sgt, angkuh sangat, sampai tak boleh persoal.

If they do , we sure question, where they get the money, they cannot afford it on their ciput salaryYou never hear means the people you mix with those that suka berlagak2.

Even the siku dan lutut guy Nasaruddin was questioned before, he also can answer.Anwar also kena question why he use private jet to fly from Peninsula to Sabah/Sarawak.  Selamba aje jawab, no problemHe cannot do, lagi people suspect. People question how can he afford to buy such a luxurious car for his 2nd wife.
