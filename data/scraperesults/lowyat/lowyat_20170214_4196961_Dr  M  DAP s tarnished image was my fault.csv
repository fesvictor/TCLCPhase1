Lets take an objective look.  What praises has DAP heaped on Mahathir so far?  Is DAP doing all this with just the only objective of garnering more Malay voters?  Or is DAP working with Mahathir to save Malaysia the main objective.  Malaysia isn't doing so well at the moment, if you could just put aside your politics tainted glasses for a moment. Does working with Mahathir means DAP will adopt Mahathirism?  So far, there is little indication of that happening.  It is just bullshit, I think.   So save it lah.  Your suggestion is really to help UMNO so that they get to say Mahathir is now DAP, LKS's lackey or whatever spin fits the seasons."
