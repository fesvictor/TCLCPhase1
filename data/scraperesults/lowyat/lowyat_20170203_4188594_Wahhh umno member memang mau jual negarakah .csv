silent_stalker,20170203,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 820,201204,,"No bro. U may not know it, but most that work in the gov does. We literally have no direction on where we were heading that time. I did lots of paper pushing that time to spend my time instead of doing actual work. ( but my filing became organized, which is nice COZ I HAD SO MUCH TIME TO DO IT) There are lots of things that he had done, but not sure if can write here. Some people defended him saying he didnt much time to familiar himself with the duty of a PM, but I can tell u I had a lot of facepalm situations under him. He is more like trial and error kind of leader instead of doing more research before deciding on a move. Which explains his flip flop."

silent_stalker,20170203,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 820,201204,,"Its debatable. My pov, GLCs are places to put politicians who wish to retire or forced to retire from politics. Or even high rank army personnels, high rank civil servant that have retired. Are these people smart? Its kind of hard to answer that."
