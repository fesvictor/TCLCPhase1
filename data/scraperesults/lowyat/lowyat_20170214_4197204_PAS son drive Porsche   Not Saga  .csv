If we had in fact received RM90 million we would use to uphold Islam and help the rakyat, not buy cars,"" said Khairil Nizam.Quote[U]""I had already explained that the car belongs to my son, who bought it in England last year (2012) at a cost of about RM100,000"" ""We at PAS Federal Territories believe there was never a RM90 million contribution to any of our leaders"""

MsGaijin,20170214,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200812,,"""In this context"", I would like to make an assumption....just an assumption, remember that word - ""assumption"" that the ""context"" was based on your perception and understanding of the article written by the reporter. Yeah, a kid can indeed interpret, even a senile old grandma can but whether it is accurate or not is a fucking different story~ So, what the reporter did was to publish what she interpret out of the interview, not exactly what had been said by the interviewee. You do realize that in a case of a defamation suit, every word uttered will be taken into account and scrutinized thoroughly not only contextually, but literally and textually as well. #PeterBandermann hates spinning journalism~"
