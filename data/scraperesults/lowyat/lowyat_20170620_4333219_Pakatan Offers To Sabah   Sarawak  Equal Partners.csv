Why do you think there are so many illegal logging activities in Sabah and Sarawak. If the politicians there were really running the country for the benefit of the people that illegal activities would have stopped a long time ago

Just hand over everything to local state gov, let them manage their own. Infact, this whole thing should be expanded to all states. All state autonomy should be a thing by now."
