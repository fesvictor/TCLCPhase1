For us internally, it is not confusing,"" he said.Muhyiddin said the leadership was decided by consensus among component parties.""All our suggestions were considered and the presidential council made a decision, one that was accepted by all,"" he said.Last week, Pakatan Harapan announced that Anwar would be its de facto leader, Dr Mahathir its chairman and Dr Wan Azizah its president.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...zB8sUHRPj1hb.99"

It depended on the circumstances prevailing at the time, I might change my mind again next year. You just wait.”On the appointment of a candidate for the Prime Minister's post, Dr Mahathir said he wanted to keep the element of surprise as this was part of the election strategy.“We will announce the name at a proper time. It can be now, it can be before the election, or immediately after we win the election,"" he said.""Some of us, are not easily forgive and forget."
