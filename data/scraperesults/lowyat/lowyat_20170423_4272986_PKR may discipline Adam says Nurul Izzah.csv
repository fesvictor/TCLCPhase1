""The PKR disciplinary committee will take action against any party member found guilty of breaking the law, especially corruption. ""Of course, we want those charged (in court) to be given fair treatment. However, if found guilty, the party will respect it (court decision) because integrity, transparency and accountability make up the key to the party.""Anyone found guilty of violating the laws of Malaysia, including in corruption cases would be tried by the party''s disciplinary committee,"" she told reporters after the Keadilan Terengganu Convention 2017 here, today. Terengganu PKR chairman Azan Ismail was also present at the convention.Nurul Izzah, who is also Lembah Pantai MP said this when asked to comment on the case against the 30-year-old Adam, who is also a businessman.
