Coup De Grace,20170603,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,201611,,"GEORGE TOWN: The family of the late Karpal Singh was caught by surprise after a Taoist temple decided to display an idol resembling the late MP and lawyer at its premises in Teluk Intan, Perak.However, Karpal's son, Ramkarpal, said that the family has not decided what to do about on the statue.""We don't want to offend any religion,"" said the Bukit Gelugor MP on Saturday.He said his family came to know about the matter on Thursday when photographs of the idol went viral on social media. The story of the idol was also widely reported by Chinese newspapers.In Teluk Intan, Tokong Da Bo Gong caretaker Goh Chai Huat said he commissioned the statue, made from camphor wood, from China.Karpal, the former DAP national chairman, was killed in a road accident on April 17, 2014. He was then the Bukit Gelugor MP.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...7w2H33tsbTiF.99"
