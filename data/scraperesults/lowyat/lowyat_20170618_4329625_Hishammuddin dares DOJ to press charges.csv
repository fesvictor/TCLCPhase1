When they press charges, those charged have a chance to clear their names,"" he added.https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/386002#ixzz4kKjqXghC"

Binaryteo,20170618,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,201203,,DOJ won't give a shit if the crimes were committed in Malaysia but the monies were invested in the US. The monies you invest in other countries must be verified legal otherwise consider as money laundering.
