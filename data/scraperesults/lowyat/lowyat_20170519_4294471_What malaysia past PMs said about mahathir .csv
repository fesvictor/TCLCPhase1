I wonder if Mahathir was at the helm when our country got independence, would Malaya be still called Malaysia or Mahathirasia. Tunku Abdul RahmanMalaysia’s Father of Independence, is undoubtedly the most loved Prime Minister of the country. While the entire nation heaps hymns of praises for Tunku Abdul Rahman, Mahathir has a completely different take. Recently, Mahathir made the headlines again for saying if the non-Malays were not expelled from Malaysia, why should the Rohingyas. Little does he realise if the non-Malays were indeed exiled, Mahathir would be in Kerala, India, today. Mahathir repeatedly invokes racial sentiments by making bigotry statements. He once said “One should look back and remember that Tunku Abdul Rahman was worse than me, he gave one million citizenships to people who are not qualified and not even tested”, referring to Chinese and Indians. Why does Mahathir despise Tunku so much? It is because Tunku sacked Mahathir from UMNO. Tun Abdul Razak Malaysia’s second Prime Minister played a pivotal role in allowing Mahathir back into UMNO. It was Razak who gave Mahathir a second shot in politics. How did Mahathir repay him? Mahathir once insinuated that Razak was the one responsible behind the 1969 racial riots, definitely the darkest period in the history of the nation. [In fact, the truth is Tunku Abdul Rahman sacked Mahathir from UMNO because Mahathir was alleged to be the brainchild behind the May 13 incident. Tun Hussein OnnIt was Tun Hussein Onn who gave Mahathir a sniff as the premier of the country by appointing Mahathir as his Deputy after becoming the Prime Minister on the demise of Abdul Razak. Mahathir, being a wily Keralan, cunningly manoeuvred Hussein Onn off the PM’s seat and capsised it himself for two decades. Mahathir accused Hussein’s wife of running Petronas from home. Mahathir then secretly sent opposition leaders in DAP documents on Exxon allegedly stealing Malaysian oil on the high seas unknown to Petronas. The then DAP secretory-general, Lim Kit Siang, later got embroiled in a legal suit in court with Exxon as a result of the allegations. When Hussein Onn went to London on a later date, Mahathir spread rumours that Hussein had a terrible heart condition and was stepping down as the Prime Minister on his return to the country. Isn’t it ironic how DAP inadvertently assisted Mahathir becoming the fourth Prime Minister of the country? Tun Abdullah Ahmad BadawiMalaysia’s fifth Prime Minister was not spared from the spade of Mahathir either. On resuming office from Mahathir in 2003, Badawi led Barisan Nasional to one if its biggest wins ever in the 2004 general election. However, a devastating outcome in the subsequent general elections was used as ammunition for Mahathir to oust Badawi. Was it really the results of the election that invoke Mahathir to oust Badawi? Of course not. Badawi did not bow down to Mahathir and numerous projects by Mahathir’s cronies were discontinued and many others were not granted permission. Mahathir even went personal on Badawi labelling him ‘sleepy’ and ‘lazy’.Datuk Seri Mohammad Najib Abdul Razak Mahathir is presently at his best again. Wave after wave of attacks are being targeted towards Najib’s administration. So far, Najib seems to be the venomoid against the 90 years old serpent. Mahathir so far failed in his attempts to oust Najib. Instead, for the first time, Mahathir is being forced to activate his defence mechanism against attacks on him and his family, and he is powerless to get the attackers arrested and thrown in jail as he always does. Will Mahathir eventually prevail in his quest or will he get his legacy trashed to tatters is something only the future will tell. I am definitely hoping for the latter.http://www.malaysia-today.net/mahathir-has...-with-everyone/Im adding thisTunku Abd RahmanTranscripts from Tunku’s recordings have been published and many statements from Malaysia’s Prince best summarises Mahathir’s ruling regime:• “There is no law, no justice, no freedom of speech. Anybody who speaks out goes to prison. So he has got all the members of the opposition in prison… This is what worries me and all the responsible citizens of this country, no matter what race they come from. We are all worried. The country is drained, dry, no more capital. People are saying in this country today, there are three big robbers – Umno robs the bank, MCA robs the co-operative societies and MIC robs the highway…”• “…There is no more democracy. You say anything, you are put in (jail) and you are not allowed to reply nor allowed to hold rallies to defend yourself. Only Mahathir can go from place to place to attack us…”Tun hussein onnMy question is, where is this original UMNO now? The UMNO loved by all Malays, which had united the Malays with other races, which had brought prosperity and tranquility to this nation and its people and which had successfully fought for Independence — that UMNO is no more in existence. It was declared illegal and dissolved by Dr. Mahathir and his friends and replaced by another party named UMNO Baru. If we were to compare UMNO Baru’s form and structure to that of original UMNO, whether from the angle of its constitution or principles, where do we find any similarities between the two? The formation of UMNO Baru is an act of treachery and cannot be forgiven either by the members of the original UMNO or new UMNO. Despite the deterioration in my health including a heart attack, I responded by declaring that I would fight the traitors till the bitter end” — Tun Hussein Onn’s speech to voters in Parit Raja during a by-election in 1988."
