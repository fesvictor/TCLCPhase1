There has been talk that Najib, who is Prime Minister, may opt to call for polls this year.Barisan communications director Datuk Seri Abdul Rahman Dahlan said Najib and Dr Ahmad Zahid were active participants in all the sessions held.“This is the fourth Barisan retreat held and in all honesty, the spirit of brotherhood and camaraderie now is stronger than ever – not just at the national level but at state level including in Sabah and Sarawak.”Asked whether differences of opinion among component parties over the Private Member’s Bill to amend the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act had cast a shadow over the coalition, Abdul Rahman replied: “The issues are plenty but because of the Prime Minister’s leadership and our emphasis on consensus, we can overcome them.”“Our component party leaders are people who understand the spirit. The DNA of Barisan and our unity is not easily rocked as we have a proven and time-tested system.”Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah (PBRS) president Tan Sri Joseph Kurup said the component parties were in “high spirits” after the retreat.“We will be working more closely to make sure that we move forward as one team for the general election.”Asked whether specifics such as seat distribution among component parties were discussed, Kurup said: “We were told what we need to do to be ready but as for the details, I believe they will be discussed later.”MIC president Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam said on March 29 that the retreat would be attended by more than 300 Barisan component party leaders.“Barisan is ready for the general election and while preparations are ongoing, it will be intensified,” he said.Kelantan Barisan chairman Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamad, who had travelled to Japan on Thursday to attend the Asean economic ministers’ meeting, returned to Kuala Lumpur the next day to attend the retreat.“The meeting was a get-together for all Barisan component party leaders to share notes and take part in several political courses,” said Mustapa, who caught a flight back to Japan last night to resume the Asean meeting.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...DvxGIwHiXFdE.99"
