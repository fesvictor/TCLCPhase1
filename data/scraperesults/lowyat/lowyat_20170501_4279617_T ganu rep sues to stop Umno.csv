Malay Reservation land is ONLY for Malays. DUMNO membership now consists of DUMB UNITED MAMAKS. NANAKS and OTHERS...thus DUMNO. ...But your State is the one that has given another MAMAK called ZAKIR tak NAIK Royal Treatment and your MB wanted to give him an island fro him to preach to all of you who dont understand the Koran, how to go to Hell. Even the DEevil knows his intent and the Trengganu gormen's intent.4 minutes ago HardboiledWell done for bringing this issue to light. A political party cannot be allowed to hold rights to Malay reserved land as it is too easily used to influence voting on a grand scale. Even teachers should know that if your landlord says vote me or lose your home, it would be an easy task to garner votes. Eventually all lands owned by UMNO would take all the malay votes in any of those lands. PKR, BERSATU, PAS, AMANAH, and even DAP stand to lose much from this enactment.25 minutes ago Oscar KiloPadan muka. You reap what you sow.37 minutes ago AppumA case of ...what Umno wants, Umno takes?44 minutes ago Dont just talkGreed amongst UMNO leaders in Trengganu has no limit for which leader in his right mind would pass a State amendment to allow UMNO malays to take over ownership of Malay reserve land in the State.Knowing that UMNO is invincible during General Election and yet PAS party refused to join Pakatan Harapan in the coalition to face UMNO/BN and rather have a 3 corners fight which favours UMNO.What is there for Azan Ismail to cry over the Trengganu State amendment..an hour ago Anonymous_1404802125Haha.. funny kind of justification by these keropok lekok (which contains full of rotten fish) eating idiots. Johor has already set a precedent. The crook exco converted Malay reserve lands by way of deception to be sold to big time developers. Soon DUMNO will gadai all the land to the Tongsang crooks following the foot steps of the greatest crook of all time.an hour ago Anonymous #03815719Ha ha a very good one. The so called defenders of Malay Rights. Just imagine what will happen if PAS takes over the State in GE14, they won't able to develope the malay teserve land for the benefits of Malays , without UMMO 's consent.an hour ago allforitPAS members are mostly teachers (religious I assume). None have legal background. And they want to run the country? ""We want to protect lands owned by UMNO so it remains under Malays becos UMNO members are Malays"". Going by that illogical reasoning, if it falls under corrupted hands, it okay as it is still in Malay hands. I give up with these moronic kind of reasoning.an hour ago Anonymous 1906531489659749Sapu kings at work again.an hour ago StevenForMalaysiaGua lau, this is how the corrupted Malays whack the national or State wealth to enrich themselves under the pretext of Bumiputra and push all the blames to non-Malays especially Chinese when time is right. How long would this go.an hour ago"
