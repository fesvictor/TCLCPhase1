expendables,20170716,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201310,,"http://www.theindependent.sg/zahid-to-make...os-within-umno/ Zahid to make his move amid chaos within Umno?After recent appointment of Hisham as Special Functions Minister by MO1, speculation is rife that if MO1 does make a run into exile after GE14, he will hand over to Hisham. If MO1 wins GE14, that gives him new mandate to reshuffle succession and Zahid will probably be framed as less supportive/insubordinate and pushed out like Muhyiddin and Hisham installed #2.If GE14 is called in Sept 2017, then Zahid knows he has a short window of just 2 months to make his move to topple MO1.Will Zahid have the balls or will he just be holding his balls like a scared rabbit in headlights?Let us all look forward to this upcoming blockbuster episode of fall of MO1"

VoidDance,20170717,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 7,201703,,Do not underestimate Zahid. He is cunning. He was after all in the wrong team once and look where he end up now. He is using his influence in KDN to shake things up there. Now placing his men in important government agencies that can decide his fate in long run.
