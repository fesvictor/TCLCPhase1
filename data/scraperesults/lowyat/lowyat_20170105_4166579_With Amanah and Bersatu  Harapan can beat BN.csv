@zan65,20170105,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201612,From: Penang - Skudai,"Pakatan Rakyat should have learned by now that what they need is not the number of votes to garner, but the distribution. They should focus on the rural area should they want to win. The winning system is not based on popularity. I'm not siding to anyone, but the error on the strategy is very obvious. They need to learn at least, from the history. Apparently, they are not. Good luck."

dangerminimouse,20170105,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 95,201609,,"A lot of people still not know if Amanah exist. It is difficult for them to let people know they exist, when gahmen and Puss parti forbid religious places to be use by Amanah for publicity.Pribumi is still new parti. That's why Barang Naik smart, they want to get the election in this year, so those parti not have the chance to do more promotion."
dangerminimouse,20170105,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 95,201609,,"looks good on paper but in reality we all far from target. We all saw what happened to Semangat 46, it was a whitewash. Even if they can remotely win, once they control the gahmen, there obviously gonna be a lot of internal fighting. Parti pribumi and dap sure got a lot of big gaps to narrow in terms of objective. Then infighting in pkr and dap also another big problem.Plus the fact that there are apparently allege banggla rigging in vote. Redrawing of borders. Eg, kapar is 100,000 voters while some rural place in Pahang can be only 20000 voters. Its just not well balanced between opposition and gahmen areas."
