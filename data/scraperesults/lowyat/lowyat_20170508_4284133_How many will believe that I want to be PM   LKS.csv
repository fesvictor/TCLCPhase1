Today, South Korea is one of the richest, most developed and prosperous nations in the world.Sixty years ago, any notion of democracy and human rights in South Korea was non-existent as it was ruled by a dictatorship. But today, the South Korean Parliament could impeach the South Korean president and eight judges of the South Korean Constitutional Court could unanimously uphold the impeachment of the South Korean president by the South Korean Parliament on charges of corruption and cronyism.Turned into a ‘global kleptocracy’ overnightThis is something which is unthinkable under the present political and justice system in Malaysia, despite the unprecedented international 1MDB money-laundering scandal that has turned Malaysia into a “global kleptocracy” overnight - unless there is a major change in the system of governance in Malaysia in GE14.I have with me a chart of the 22-year annual Transparency International (TI) Corruption Perception Index (CPI) from 1995-2006, which shows how other countries have moved forward to become mature developed nations practising the principles of integrity and good governance, while we Malaysia had stagnated, and worse, gone backwards over the decades.In the first year of TI CPI in 1995, which listed only 41 countries, Malaysia was ranked in the middle position of No 23, with a score above the midpoint - ie 5.28 on a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean).China and Indonesia came in at the bottom end, with China ranked as No 40 with a score of 2.16 out of 10, while Indonesia came in last ranking No 41 out of 41, with a score of 1.94.If Malaysia had made a decimal improvement in the TI CPI score of 0.1 point each year the past 22 years, Malaysia’s present score would have been 7.48, or roughly translated into 74.8 out of a scale increased from 10 to 100, which would have placed Malaysia in the rank around No 18 out of 176 countries.Unfortunately, despite all “thunder and lightning” about anti-corruption in Malaysia, Malaysia’s TI CPI worsened with the TI CPI ranking falling to No 55 out of 176 countries while the TI CPI score fell below the midpoint to 49 in the new scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean).In contrast, both China and Indonesia have made significant improvements in the TI CPI in the past 22 years, with China improving its score from 2.16/10 in 1995 to 40/100 with its TI CPI ranking from No 40/41 in 1995 to 79/176 in 2016 and Indonesia improving its score from 1.94/10 in 1995 to 37/100 with TI CPI ranking from 41/41 in 1995 to 90/176.If for the next two decades, China and Indonesia improve in their TI CPI ranking and score at their pace in the past 22 years, both countries would have overtaken Malaysia in both the TI CPI ranking and score well before 2040, a decade before TN 2050 – Najib’s chimerical time-line for another “National Transformation” of Malaysia, from “bad, to worse, and then worst”!It must be matter of grave concern to all patriotic Malaysians that, instead of addressing these political, economic, educational and social issues which show that Malaysia is losing out in the international race of nations in progress and development, there is instead an escalation in the politics of lies, hate and fear exploiting the primodial issues of race and religion.The escalation of the Umno/BN demonieation campaign of lies, hate and fear against me is not because I have suddenly, after 51 years in politics, become the No 1 threat to Umno/BN government, but an indication of the fear and even panic of some Umno/BN leaders and strategists that Umno/BN could lose GE14.I call on all political parties to focus on how to save Malaysia from becoming a kleptocratic state and getting into the trajectory of a failed and rogue state by restoring our capability to compete with the rest of the world - and to renounce the politics of lies, curses, hate and fear, whether racial or religious.LIM KIT SIANG is the MP for Gelang Patah and DAP parliamentary leader.The views expressed here are those of the author/contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of Malaysiakini."
