Barisan or the Federal Government has also never discussed this matter before,” she said, adding that there were distinct backgrounds and conditions as to how Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya became FT.Kuala Lumpur, said Chew, was Malaysia’s capital city and Putrajaya, its federal administrative centre, while Labuan was the offshore federal financial centre.“There is no strong and compelling reason to turn Penang into an FT. The proposal has stirred much controversy, which is unnecessary,” she said.In George Town, Penang Gerakan vice-chairman Oh Tong Keong said Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng should address the environmental issues if he really loved the state.“He should look into more pressing issues like illegal hill clearing, flash floods and the purchase of pre-war houses by foreigners,” he said.Citing The Star’s report, the state, he said, had acknowledged that nine out of 29 hill clearing cases on the island, as reported by Penang Forum, were illegal.“Didn’t the state government pledge that it would closely monitor the hill clearing issues? Are you sincere in loving Penang?” he said.Oh said the state government also failed to live up to its promises, such as free parking over the weekend and the abolishment of the Sungai Nyior toll.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...pJwdlm7y0bIh.99"
