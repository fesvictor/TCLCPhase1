It is a desperate attempt by insensitive and irresponsible people to politicise a non-existent issue during a sensitive time such as this.“The news article attempts to demonise and paint a negative picture of DAP leaders and the party, especially in our struggles for a better Malaysia,” Chong said.He said the website is not owned or run by Pakatan Harapan and that by the choice of its name, the website had falsely made itself out to be an opposition-run site.He said the website intends to criminally defame and paint the DAP Sarawak leaders in a bad light. It is also disrespectful and contemptuous towards the late Adenan. He added that the site also carries fake news on the Opposition.“We respect and mourn together with the families and loved ones of the late chief minister together with Sarawakians and strongly condemn anyone who attempts to deceive, mislead or sow hatred to undermine the peaceful nature of our state,” Chong said."
