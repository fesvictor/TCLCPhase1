This has brought shame to Malaysia,” said Chong.Chong said former SUPP president Tan Sri Peter Chin did issue a press statement in May last year to explain the matter but, based on the statement, did not deny the receipt of RM1 million from Najib to SUPP.“For a party president facing such allegation but cannot deny in a clear term, that is tantamount to admission that SUPP did receive the amount.“(SUPP president Datuk) Dr Sim (Kui Hian) on the same occasion (last year) said he did not know anything, just pushed it to Peter Chin,” asserted Chong.He said even though the donation was not regarded as illegal in Malaysia, it should be seen as immoral.He opined that a political party like SUPP should practise a higher standard of decency, morality and integrity compared to celebrities.“I’m just puzzled why they cannot return the RM1 million, which is just a small amount to SUPP.”http://www.theborneopost.com/2017/07/03/po...tform=hootsuite"
