It is all short-term and that is not what we want when we talk about Sabah for Sabahans.""We want a strong Sabah to fight for what is really needed like an education policy and how we manage our resources... I like DAP's vision and I like the 'New Deal' which is being drafted now.""Jannie said that she was very excited about the 30 percent women as decision-makers stated in DAP's Constitution and that the party was serious about it to the extent that it even changed its Constitution to reflect that."

That parent been shat on by his /her spouse spouse. You know. That parent married that married the other person. The parent promised you this, he promised you that. Yet, as a child you see different things. For some reason or another you're the one seeing that the mother is feeding the father despite the father saying ""we'll feed each other. We're in this together."" You're the child of that union. You saw as your mother's items all taken. Your mom's okay with it initially. I mean, she did it to give face. For the father's 'honour'. Even though it was an arranged marriage. Your mother, despite being bullied, lied to, swindled over and over again by the father. And your brothers and sisters say ""well its like that, so let it be. We're family"".Then one day, one of your little brothers said ""you know, I don't want the family to break up. But dad's not treating mom right"". And that can be nothing further than the truth. What do you CHOOSE? To go with status quo? Or to actually tell the dad straight off ""you're bullying mom"". Because dad took the money from the two moms, and gave it to dad's relatives. The two mother's children got nothing, not even pittance and instead were given more shit, but were taught from young ""its alright, we're family. Its the right thing"". You. Tell. Me.What. To. Choose. To. Do."

Let's leave the other thread, where the supposed mourners and hipster hypocrites can continue mourning like their father just died. As if the dearly departed has achieved all that much in his time in office and saved their lives.Sarawakians, are mostly ignorant and keen to follow our baser instincts. Why think, when you can get emotional and stuff right? Cry and momma will buy a new toy.We're on opposing sides of the coin, or are we. I advocate looking at the bigger picture, realizing the BN machinery at work. You can't deny that the politicians are all complicit. They don't issue ultimatums, they compromise. Election FD in return for compromise on certain populist matters.As I have said, know your enemy. At this moment any talks of secession or any meaningful independence is a false hope. Empty dreams. When you realize that, you can see the game being played here."

itekderp,20170112,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 619,201405,,"Hyper, replying you here from the other thread due to hypersensitive yokels.You have an issue with the ABBN stance. Why does it irk you so.I understand it probably seems rational to vote for the MP who helps your area more. But big picture, will you do it if you know it costs other areas some detriment? It's a very selfish thought, to vote based on local affiliations. And that's what BN is banking on. Like I said, divide and conquer. We're more divided than ever, we don't give a toss what happens so long as we have our cake right. Think of the country as a whole. Malaysia falls, we fall. We're all in this together. Is that so hard to realize? Or do you still dream we can actually be autonomous?"

What I feel is that Sabah and Sarawak should really stand up and demand what's right. Centralization of urban concentration is a bad sign for us. Just like how Sabahans and Sarawakians flock to Klang valley, it means that our capital cities and the industries are not well developed enough. The fact is, capitalism and greed is not helping. There are a lot of issues, so I am not going to really peel everything one by one, since its one big intricate web.Minimum wage in Sabah and Sarawak is much lower, but cost of expenses is more by 30% compared to Peninsular thanks to the cabotage policies. How? Are we going to still remain giving so much and take shit? No.Federal has always avoided developing Sabah and Sarawak. Its only the recent hoo haa after all the talks of 'autonomy' that we're getting 'dedak' (or whatever, which again, I feel miserable because the late CM has explained how the funding is procured and what it seems to be isn't what it really is). As much as I'm angry against Peninsular, i'm not a pro-secessionist in any sense. But I also felt that anger brewing in me when I studied in Peninsular, and thought to myself ""why can' we have all the good things? We had all the oil money and its wasted here in Peninsular"". That was when fossil fuel was still giving a great income, not even considering the palm oil (before a certain national party tried to screw over Robert Kuok and now we're paying for the silly move as an entire nation)."
itekderp,20170112,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 619,201405,,"Very true. Maybe it's a bit idealistic given the situation we're in, but all I ask for is that we are given equal rights economically at least to progress as we should. But it's frustrating to see the issues we have being subverted politically just to gain votes, with the normal people non the wiser. You see people happy thinking ""oh we got federal to give us this point that point"". When the fact is it's always been our right. You don't just starve the state, and then give them a bit claiming it's out of good will. It's our right.Again, the late CM was on the right track which is appreciated. But this is just the beginning, the people should never lose view of the things that actually matter, don't fall for the populist nonsense propagated by politicians. Otherwise we really are happy if given a bag of rice a vote.The status quo really sucks, huh."
hyperyouth_firepower,20170112,BlackBerry enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,647",200504,"From: Sabah, Malaysia.",irregardless. we'll just have to wait and see what happens. But i feel that Sarawak should still fight for what's rightfully theirs.
