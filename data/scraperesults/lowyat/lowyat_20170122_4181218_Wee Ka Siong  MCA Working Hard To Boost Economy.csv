And we don’t collect a single sen from them.“Instead of questioning the Barisan Nasional government’s efforts and chiding us on everything we do, DAP must instead show how it plans to bring long-term investments to benefit Malaysia,” he said.On another matter, Dr Wee said that schools which had received government allocations should utilise the funds to develop and upgrade their facilities instead of letting the money sit idle in the bank.It was important to utilise the funds for the benefit of the students so that the schools will have the chance of receiving more allocations in future, he said.“There is no point in keeping the money and it defeats the purpose of asking for an allocation,” he told reporters after distributing cheques to representatives from 89 Chinese schools in Johor.He said the schools received the RM2mil Johor government-allocated funds as promised by Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin following a meeting with MCA in October last year.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...-boost-economy/"
