darthboyzzee,20170126,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,"AHMAD AMZAD HASHIM | 26 Januari 2017.AKTA 355 bukanlah suatu akta yang baru. Nama lainnya ialah Akta Mahkamah Syariah (Bidang Kuasa Jenayah) 1965 , pindaan 1984. Kerana itulah kita ada Mahkamah Syariah di setiap negeri dan seluruh negara pada hari ini.Akta 355 ini sudah diadakan sejak tahun 1965 lagi. Ketika itu Mahkamah Syariah telah diberi kuasa menghukum 6 bulan penjara, RM1,000 denda atau kedua-dua sekali.Tiada siapa pernah mempertikaikan Akta 355 sebagai melanggar perlembagaan Malaysia ketika itu walau negara sudah lama ada parti politik bukan Islam seperti DAP, MCA, Gerakan atau MIC.Pada tahun 1984, Akta 355 dipinda memberi kuasa 3 tahun penjara, RM5,000 denda dan sebatan 6 kali. Pindaan ini dilakukan di Parlimen. Dibahaskan dan diluluskan di Parlimen. Seperti hari ini juga.Sekali lagi DAP dan parti bukan Islam yang lain tiada pula mempertikaikan pindaan ini, jauh sekali menyebut pindaan 'melanggar' Perlembagaan Malaysia.Pada tahun 1989, Akta 355 dipinda lagi. Kali ini supaya diperluaskan ke Sabah dan Sarawak.Pindaan 1989 ini pun tiada pernah ada yang bangkitkan soal melanggar perlembagaan Malaysia.Rakyat Malaysia yang bukan Islam menghormati Mahkamah Syariah sebagai urusan agama Islam yang tidak pantas dicampuri bukan Islam.Anehnya apabila Akta 355 mahu dipinda pada tahun ini setelah pindaan kuasa hukuman kali terakhir dibuat pada tahun 1984, 32 tahun yang lalu, berbangkit bermacam-macam dakwaan kononnya melanggar perlembagaan persekutuan. Padahal ia cuma soal menambah kuasa hukuman sahaja. Sama sahaja seperti berlaku pindaan tahun 1984.Umat Islam mempunyai sebab yang kuat untuk memperkasakan peranan Mahkamah Syariah. Ini kerana usaha pendidikan yang ada perlu seiring dengan undang-undang yang tegas bagi menjaga kesejahteraan semua. Tempoh 1965 hingga 1984, masalah dan cabaran sosial dalam negara tidak sehebat hari ini.Hari ini Malaysia dicatat di peringkat dunia ditangga ke-8 industri pelacuran, ditangga ke10 kadar penggunaan arak/alkohol, pusat perjudian tersohor, gejala amalan rasuah, korupsi. Masalah dalam masyarakat berkait runtuhnya rumahtangga oleh kadar perceraian yang membimbangkan, kadar kelahiran bayi luar nikah yang sangat tinggi, kadar kes buang bayi dan lain lain lagi. Kes penagihan dadah, bohsia, rempit sebahagian besarnya berakar umbi kerana ketiadaan jiwa yang sejahtera oleh runtuhnya sistem hidup berkeluarga yang sempurna. Statistik yang ada menunjukkan umat Islam menyumbang peratus tertinggi dalam kebanyakan gejala negatif yang kronik ini.Umat Islam yang menjadi 65 peratus dari rakyat Malaysia perlu kembali kepada undang-undang yang ditentukan oleh ajaran Islam sebagai ubat terbaik memulihkan mutu individu orang-orang Islam.Kelihatan yang langgar perlembagaan bukan usul pindaan RUU355. Tetapi perbuatan menghalang umat Islam mematuhi syariat Islam itu sendirilah perbuatan melanggar perlembagaan. Ini kerana jika agama lain diberi kebebasan untuk diamalkan, mengapa menghalang diamalkan Islam oleh penganut Islam walhal Islam sudahpun menjadi agama bagi persekutuan.Beraninya segelintir bukan Islam mempertikai dan campur tangan urusan agama Islam adalah kerana adanya kalangan orang Islam sendiri yang mempertikaikan.Ia tidak akan berlaku begitu jika umat Islam bersatu. Tidak akan berlaku begitu jika tiada orang Islam yang jadi tali barut mereka yang anti Islam. Tidak jadi begitu jika orang Islam tidak terlalu obses sangat dengan sokongan politik bukan Islam kerana cita-cita politik peribadinya.Lihat kandungan Perlembagaan Malaysia perkara 3.""Perkara 3. Agama bagi Persekutuan(1) Islam ialah agama bagi Persekutuan; tetapi agama-agama lain boleh diamalkan dengan aman dan damai di mana-mana Bahagian Persekutuan.(2) Di dalam tiap-tiap Negeri selain Negeri-Negeri yang tidak mempunyai Raja, kedudukan Raja sebagai Ketua agama Islam di Negerinya mengikut cara dan setakat yang diakui dan ditetapkan oleh Perlembagaan Negeri itu, dan, tertakluk kepada Perlembagaan itu, segala hak, keistimewaan, prerogatif dan kuasa yang dinikmati olehnya sebagai Ketua agama Islam, tidaklah tersentuh dan tercacat; tetapi dalam apa-apa perbuatan, amalan atau upacara yang berkenaan dengannya Majlis Raja-Raja telah bersetuju bahawa perbuatan, amalan atau upacara itu patut diperluas ke seluruh Persekutuan, setiap Raja lain hendaklah atas sifatnya sebagai Ketua agama Islam membenarkan Yang di-Pertuan Agong mewakilinya.(3) Perlembagaan-Perlembagaan Negeri Melaka, Pulau Pinang, Sabah dan Sarawak hendaklah masing-masing membuat peruntukan bagi memberi Yang di-Pertuan Agong kedudukan sebagai Ketua agama Islam di Negeri itu.(4) Tiada apa-apa jua dalam ini mengurangkan mana-mana peruntukan lain dalam Perlembagaan ini.(5) Walau apa pun apa-apa jua dalam Perlembagaan ini, Yang di-Pertuan Agong hendaklah menjadi Ketua Agama Islam di Wilayah-Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Labuan dan Putrajaya; dan bagi maksud ini Parlimen boleh melalui undang-undang membuat peruntukan-peruntukan bagi mengawal selia hal ehwal agama Islam dan bagi menubuhkan suatu Majlis untuk menasihati Yang di-Pertuan Agong mengenai perkara-perkara yang berhubungan dengan agama Islam""Pada saya, lebih 'jantan' DAP membawa sahaja ke Mahkamah Tinggi bagi memperoleh jawapan sama ada dakwaan mereka bahawa RUU355 melanggar perlembagaan itu benar atau tidak.Kerana keputusan da kes iaitu saman parti Gerakan terhadap EKJSII kelantan dan saman empat individu Islam terhadap RUU355 ternyata tidak mendokong dakwaan DAP. Malah kes EJKS telah dibawa dari Mahkamah Tinggi ke Mahkamah Rayuan dan sehingga mahkamah yang paling tinggi sekali Mahkamah Persekutuan. Keputusannya adalah sama.Kepada seluruh umat Islam, jangan uzurkan diri daripada menghadiri Perhimpunan Perpaduan Umat Islam Menyokong Memperkasakan Mahkamah Syariah H355 pada 18 Februari 2017 di Kuala Lumpur.Jika umat Islam Indonesia boleh berkumpul hingga 7 juta orang bagi memberi mesej solidariti ummah, kita patut malu jika kita gagal menyatukan suara juga sebegitu. – HARAKAHDAILY 26/1/2017http://www.harakahdaily.net.my/index.php/b...gaan-dakyah-dap"

And after words says its ok to not support it. In earlier stages some even call those that oppose as kafirs. Some here even question my religion when I oppose to this act. So u see what is the problem here? I have told u the difference. Add 1 more, those that support this act says it will only affect muslims, but as I said earlier, non muslim will be affected indirectly. And yet, they cant have a voice in this decision?.  ""urusan orang islam, org bukan islam jangan masuk campur"" that is tbeir reply. And as I pointed out earlier, Islam promotes fairness, does this seem fair to u? We live in a multiracial country. The way this syariah law being handled is far from fair. This is why im against it. This is not the islam way. This is humans using Islam as a tool to control other humans. Normal people like us may have no power. But we have a voice. Some people are trying to suppress this voice in the name of religion. I wont have that."

Other religion in this country have tolerated our ways for so long already. Why cant we do the same? Is it fair when their belief is affected they should just keep quite while when our belief is affected, we cant come to any tolerance? Is that the right way of Islam? Where did u get the numbers? Im sure u know there are muslims in this country are muslims only in mykad but does not practice the religion. This is a fact u cant deny. There are also muslims  that are moderates that prefer to use their brain instead of being sheeps that oppose this act. U cant just say the numbers of muslim are more than non so those that support this bill are the majority. That is very wrong."
@zan65,20170126,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201612,From: Penang - Skudai,"Then oppose the law as a whole, not only the amendment. Whats the point of opposing the amendment when it will be there forever, the reach of the law was still limited to only muslims as it was established decades ago. Even the non-muslims and people like you never aware the existence of the law after decades of living in peace. So please be clear with what you said affecting them indirectly. The history itself speaks otherwise. The only part intend for change only numbers. the big question still remains WHY ONLY NOW? The issue has been missunderstood when the first day it became the issue, many non-muslims thaught it was hudud. And I am exactly clear on who tried to politicize this to gain mileage of support. That itself has grave error. The next day, MCA and Gerakan took back their protest since they were explained and cleared. The next day, they made u-turn, they retract and reoppose the law, tho until yesterday, they admit they are still blind with what they have been opposing."

Even without any documentation or proof that it actually happened? Even when the family had said the deceased never did practiced islam in her life? Remember the case of that non muslim who wanted to marry and religious authorities come barging into the ceremony say cannot bcoz it seems the father of the bride had converted her when she was young WITHOUT EVEN HER KNOWING IT! She had lived her life not even knowing shes a muslim. And now they even allow 1 parent to convert the child without the other parent concent? There are alot more cases in the past. This is what im talking about how syariah indirectly affected the non muslim. Yes we have lived in peace for long because of the tolerance of other race n religion. Not because everyone is happy with it. Know the difference. Yes this ammendment is not about hudud. But it will pave way for hudud (human version)  to be implemented. Study it!"

Heaven already showed us the signs! banjir n shit! time to revolt against emperor jibby for he has lost his mandate from heaven!    i like your reasonings bro. keep on going with that. about time someone from within Islam itself voice out about the flaws of the syariah in this country.

gladfly,20170126,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 466,201003,,I don't support it because it goes against my belief that all laws ought to be equal.  Having 2 legal systems goes against that belief.Too many instances where one jurisdiction overlaps and oust the other. Case on point is conversion cases and the custody issue.  Even tough Parliament has finally moved to redress the injustice that it brought but its clear to see how long it took before such in justice is recognised. Justice delayed is justice denied too

But to actually know what cake it is, u need to cut it open. Thats how this bill is. It is rushed. Just think, why PAS wants this bill go fast? It is a half cooked bill. Even b4 the debate PAS already tell people and MPs to support it. Why do they want to work with BN just to have this bill passed? Doesnt it look kind of fishy to u? Think my friend. What was the thing that blocking PAS from implementing their hudud in kelantan? Ill spoonfed u. All those about increasing the punishment are just smoke screens. What they really want is the clause state gov have the right to determine the type of punishment. Yes, in the bill states any change in the syariah law must go through parliament. But remember, PAS is rushing this. Which shows there are loopholes in the bill that we are still not aware of. But 1 thing is certain, with this bill passed, PAS will now have the power to determine the type of punishment in kelantan. The only thing they need to do in the future is widen the scope of syariah to include criminal law. Im sure they already have that cake with 1 inch icing kept somewhere for future use. They were able to fool alot of people with this bill. Im sure they can do the same with the next. And u saying y I worry? . History has shown how religious laws had been abused with dire consequences. Even in this current time we can see how it is manipulated to serve the elites. AND NO ONE CAN OPPOSE IT!  It happened b4, it is also happening now in other countries. What makes u think it wont happen here? PAS already change some things in their version of hudud, what makes u think it will stop there"

The same EXACT thing was said when the 1st submission was done for HUDUD. The SAME EXACT arguement was given during the Hudud hu ha. All through those many months the only thing Hadi said was "" It doesnt effect non muslim."" end story. Same goes for Kelantan MB.Want to implement something but own self blur2 how people can trust.Not once did they answer properly the part about non muslims being victims to theft and robbery. And what if the suspects were multi religion - muslims and non muslims, both courts? Then what if multiple victims? Say robbery at kedai emas, coffee shop, then what? I have read thru the Kelantan enactment a couple of times,it did NOT state clearly on all this.The answer that came out from muslims like you was ""Kalau tak buat salah, apa takut?"" for months on end. Adui! People not talking about the thief/robber, but the victim!It was due to that and opposition from Sabah/Sarawak, Hadi amended it to 355. This 355 also not clear exactly the details, blur2 again. By right you all muslims should be more concerned cos if the Shariah judge can suka2 put the maksimum 30 years sentence means the system can be abused.TLDR: Hudud cannot, do 355 as first step. 355 success, next step raise Hudud again, doesnt take rocket scientist to figure that out. REMEMBER, it started with Hudud.2) Sabah & Sarawak oppose both Hudud and  RU 355. Adenan said that before he passed away. PBB muslim MPs announced they would not vote for it. You ask the muslim Sabah/Sarawak forumers here,  what they think.3) Does not involve non muslims?? hahaha, this issue also cannot settle :the parent convert to Islam can convert kids (and run off with the kids) without the non muslim parent giving consent or even knowing about it. The non muslim parent pulak have no jurisdiction in Shariah court, hence the long drawn out cases. Perfect way of gaining custody of the kids.In certain states, alcohol cannot be sold in malay majority areas even by non muslim shop owner cos want to mencegah muslim youths from buying. Want to mencegah catch those muslim buying lah, ban all selling for what?Remember PAS tried to ban OCtoberfest(Beer fest) even though ONLY non muslims were allowed in. PAS later did get a concert cancelled cos it said immoral ,etc.Havent include the Allah issue yet, Msia first ever country in the world to ban usage of Allah by nons."

They have lost their rights to protest when they are jailed. But normal people like u and me can protest.

Again, questioning my religion when I dont agree with ur view . Ur kind of people no other modal is it . U never heard or u refuse to hear. Just like right now. U close ur mind to any reasoning and just question the person religion. Thats how its always been. When u can no longer rebute in arguement, just question the person religion. Its easy that way instead of thinking is it?Again, I will say this. Allah gave us the ability to think, so use it. Yes, it is the umat duty to ensure syariah is a just law. I have said over and over and over again, the syariah we have now is different from the quran. Real syariah should serve justice to all religion and race under it. But the 1 we have now are leaning towards muslim only, giving advantage to 1 religion.  How can I say its better than the common law when the common law serve more justice on all races compared to syariah? Saying that the manipulated syariah that we have is better is just  pure hypocrisy."

jonoave,20170126,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,201305,,"+1.Never learn from history of the Dark Ages in Europe. Where anyone asks anything, the church says, 'You dare go against the Church? The word of God?""  Everything to twist and turn the question around. That's why the church can be so powerful and corrupted. When Renaissance came and people started to question more, that's when secularism became prevalent.if it's common or human law, both sides can argue and discuss as equals. Not one side belittling the other as traitor to religion, or you don't know about religion. The law is accepted as flawed, human made, and can be changed or adapted.If you start from the premise of a law that is perfect because it's God's word, that's where the problem starts. And it's funny how people who support religious law tends to be those who currently holds the major religion. Would you still be as supportive as religious laws in other countries e.g. Christianity? or what about a different school of though e.g. Syiah?"

Talk about how it is a sin to mengumat, later in conversation ""eh, kau tau tak bini badrul tido dengan mat deris?"" talk about its a sin to reveive bribe, when offered ""rezeki"".I admit I have my share of sins in the past. But I learn from my mistakes. But these kind of people who talks like they are holy but their actions shows otherwise. It saddens me, angry at times.And to kickrba, even if the person is a kafir or even a mualaf, I have met dozens of them who knows more about Islam than the everage muslims u meet everyday.
