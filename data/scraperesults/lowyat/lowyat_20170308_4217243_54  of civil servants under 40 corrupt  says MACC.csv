Coup De Grace,20170308,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,201611,,"PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has revealed that 54% of civil servants under the age of 40 are corrupt.MACC deputy chief commissioner (prevention) Shamshun Baharin Mohd Jamil said their penchant for luxury goods led them to resort to corrupt practices, the New Straits Times (NST) reported today.“We have cases where junior government officers and clerks can afford to buy the latest iPhone models and drive expensive cars.“Their flashy lifestyle does not match their measly pay as young officers and administrative assistants under the government pay scale,” he was quoted as saying.NST also quoted MACC deputy chief commissioner Azam Baki as saying the incidence of corruption in Malaysia was getting serious.He said MACC statistics showed 665 cases had been filed against government officers last year, while 548 civil servants had been detained for graft as of February.Azam was also reported by the NST as saying that the commission had set a three-year target to clean up corruption in the public sector.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...rupt-says-macc/"
