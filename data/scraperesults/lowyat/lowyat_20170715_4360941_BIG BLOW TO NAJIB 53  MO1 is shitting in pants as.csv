It makes possible far closer collaboration within the present opposition coalition that had up to this point found itself unable to agree on its structure and leadership.Anwar’s daughter Nurul Izzar, who confirmed that she also met with Mahathir during the London visit, went on record saying that the meeting had gone well and they had established joint commitments on future reforms. It opens the way to an agreement at the upcoming crucial meeting tomorrow, Sunday, at which it is expected agreement could finally be reached on the line up of key office holders in the coalition. Mahathir has been mooted as Chairman, which would see the giant of Malaysian politics formally returning to an active role as one of the leading figues of the Pakatan Harapan coalition.Given that both sides have now agreed to campaign for Anwar’s release and reinstatement as the opposition leader and eventual Prime Minister, Mahathir would then be a possible contender for that interim leadership role, which could have an electrifying effect on the political mood of the country.The meeting between the nonegenarian and the daughter of the man who was first sent to jail on sodomy charges during his own premiership was said to be extremely warm in London.  Nurul Izzar is believed to be especially close to Mahathir’s wife, who also attended the private meeting and posed for pictures afterwards.Panic Response?The level of panic engendered in the circle around Najib appears to have been reflected in a rare personal statement made by the Prime Minister in direct response to the Guardian article, in which the Prime Minister in turn accused Dr Mahathir of panicking in response to his calling of a Royal Inquiry into the so-called Forex crisis over twenty years ago.This is widely viewed to be an attempt to deflect attention from Najib’s own present scandals around 1MDB, FELDA and Tabung Haji and to assert an equivalence between a scandalous foreign exchange trading debacle and the straight theft by the Prime Minister of billions of dollars, much of which ended up in his own bank accounts."

JimbeamofNRT,20170719,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 181,201209,,"ah.that MAIKA scandal? I dont know when Samy Vellu or Vel Pari ,Mahathir, Anwar, Daim want to come clean and explained everything to the shareholders.-------- Maika Holdings raised RM108 million in 1981 from Indians, especially rural folks from the lower- and middle-income groups. These people were told to use their life savings – and even sell their jewelry – to invest in Maika Holdings because they were told the company would give them returns that were 10 to 20 times their initial investment. This, of course, is sweeter an offer than any licensed bank could make.Samy Vellu, whose rhetoric needs no introduction, managed to fool these mostly not-so-well- educated individuals into parting with their money.If you ask anyone who was in MIC at that time about how they organised groups of people to go out there to convince the masses to part with their money, you will be surprised. They even went to the extent of telling would-be investors to sell their properties and cattle to invest in Maika Holdings.In other countries, this would have been considered a huge financial scandal, not just because of the amount of money involved, but because of the number of people involved in fleecing equally vast numbers of poor and less-educated citizens.The RM108 million then had a buying power that was 10 to 15 times its value today. In today’s terms, it would be valued between RM1 billion and RM1.5 billion. Shortly after the initial investments were collected, the recession in the mid-1980s enabled the cash-rich Maika Holdings to go shopping for properties and collect fantastic deals.If those properties were still in the hands of Maika Holdings, the company would be worth some RM3 billion to RM5 billion today. But those properties were sold at below-market prices through shady deals in which more money was transferred under the table than through actual and legal sales agreements.Some of us may also remember the Telekom shares scandal, in which Maika Holdings was extended an offer to buy Telekom shares during its initial public offering (IPO). But Maika Holdings did not buy the Telekom shares. Instead, Samy Vellu bought them through his personal company, because Maika Holdings, supposedly, did not have the money to do so.Maika Holdings could have made RM30 million, but this opportunity was hijacked by the sole defender and representative of the Indian community.Telekom was only the first privatised government department. Since then, many other government agencies and departments have been privatised. As with Telekom Malaysia, shares were offered to Maika Holdings, but the offers were hijacked over and over again by Samy Vellu and his gang.Using the Maika Holdings money, the gang bought into well-run companies and turned them upside down by appointing their own people to run these companies, squandering away the profits with luxurious parties and lavish parties, and, finally, by closing down these companies. They plundered in epic proportions.To date, Maika shareholders have received almost nothing for their investments. The Maika Holdings scandal has cost many their life savings, property, opportunities to send their children for advanced education and so much more.-----------What went wrong?It is a case of bad management, poor investment, sheer arrogance and pure greed.In spite of a number of major acquisitions made into some important companies – like the United Asian Bank (UAB), United Oriental Assurance (UOA), Malaysian Airlines System (MAS), Malaysian International Shipping Corporation (MISC), TV3 and Edaran Otomobil Malaysia Bhd (EON) – Maika’s performance has been mediocre.There wasn’t any fanfare when Maika was allotted 10 million shares of Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Bhd (STMB). It was assumed in 1990 that Maika had been allotted all the shares it had subscribed to. No details were made known at that time.Sometime in the middle of February 1992, the shroud of secrecy surrounding the Telekom shares allocation was ripped apart. Then, all hell broke loose.A journalist from Watan disclosed that “there could have been some hanky-panky in the allocation of Telekom’s shares to Maika Holdings.This was then followed by another report in a Tamil magazine, Thoothan on April 1, 1992, which disclosed that there could have been some discrepancy in the distribution of the 10 million Telekom shares allocated to Maika by the Finance Ministry. Malaysians learned for the first time (two years after the share issuance), that Maika acquired only one million and not the entire 10 million shares that were allotted to Maika Holdings.Samy Vellu, through the Tamil Nesan and at MIC meetings, tried to explain by insisting that the cash flow problem faced by Maika did not allow Maika to take up all 10 million shares. But, one of the directors, a one-time ally of Samy Vellu, Vijendran, issued a statement insinuating that the truth may not have been told.When this matter was raised in parliament, then finance minister Anwar Ibrahim disclosed that since Maika had stated that it could take up only one million shares, the remaining nine million shares were allocated to three companies proposed by Maika because to his “ministry’s knowledge, the three companies represented the interests of the Indian community” (The Star, April 30, 1992).Note: At the time of share allocation in 1990, Tun Daim Zainuddin was the finance minister. Maika did not reject the sharesThe mystery deepened and bewildered the shareholders when another Maika director, Pasamanikam, contradicted the statements made by Anwar and Samy Vellu. According to Pasamanikam, Maika did not reject the Finance Ministry’s offer and did not propose that the nine million shares be allocated to any other company. He further revealed that Maika had indeed raised a RM50 million loan to facilitate the acquisition of the entire 10 million shares even before the Finance Ministry had withdrawn its offer. A tidal wave of questions engulfed the share holders:1) Why did the Finance Ministry cancel the initial offer of the 10 million shares and subsequently allot only one million shares to Maika?2) Who was responsible for the retraction of the original offer?3) Who lied to the Finance Ministry?4) Who informed them that Maika had recommended that the nine million shares be given to three companies?5) Who supplied the names of these three companies?6) Who coerced the Finance Ministry to change their mind?7) Who aborted this offer? (There was no earthly reason for the Finance Ministry to change its mind on its own after having allocated 10 million shares).According to GK Rama Iyer, former managing director of Maika Holdings Bhd – as revealed in his press release dated May 16, 1992 :Samy Vellu was informed at 6.10am on Oct 5, 1990, that Maika had been offered 10 million STMB shares and of the probability of obtaining full loan financing and that Maika intended to take up the entire allocation of 10 million shares. Indeed, a letter dated Oct 5, 1990, from Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bankers Bhd. (AMMBB) – offering RM50 million to finance the purchase of the 10 million shares was received on Oct 6, 1990. There must have been a mistakeHe further clarified that Samy Vellu replied that “there must have been a mistake. The offer to Maika should be for one million and not 10 million”According to Samy Vellu, the remaining nine million shares were for allocation to “other MIC bodies”.“Further, Samy Vellu stated that he would contact the ministry to clarify the position.”It was then, after Samy Vellu had contacted the Finance Ministry; that the letter of offer was retracted and Maika’s allocation reduced to only one million shares. Why did Samy Vellu prevent Maika from acquiring the 10 million shares?Wasn’t Maika his brain-child to raise the corporate wealth of the Indian community so that their economic welfare would be secured?Wasn’t he the leader of MIC which launched Maika as a business venture to enrich the community which had long been associated with deprivation and poverty?This was God-sent wealth. Why did he prevent this wealth from reaching Maika?Imagine how much Maika would have made from these shares for which it only paid RM5 per share. When Telekom shares were first traded, it fetched a price of RM6.15 per share and that too during a bearish market. By mid-1992 the share price was hovering around RM11-RM13.According to an article in the Aliran Monthly – 1993:13(10):Samy Vellu had taken away from Maika RM120 million in profits (which it would have attained had it just held on to the 10 million shares until 1993). They don’t deserve 10 million sharesSamy Vellu made it extremely clear that he personally decided to allocate only one million shares to Maika. According to Samy Vellu, “I could have given all the shares to Maika Holdings if not for their past business record. They don’t deserve 10 million shares because of the dismal performance of the Maika management. They have to learn to do business on their own and not depend on shares and make money out of it”. (New Straits Times May, 16 1992)His autocratic style and arrogance comes through so forcefully: “I could have given all the shares to Maika Holdings…,” he boasts. “They don’t deserve 10 million shares…,” he berates.It is very apparent that he keeps a very tight hold on Maika. That being the case, how could Maika undertake any business venture without his knowledge and blessing? Shouldn’t he be part of the debacle that is haunting Maika today? Shouldn’t he also shoulder the blame for “the dismal performance of the Maika management?”And why should he give nine million shares to three obscure companies?SB Management Services Sdn. Bhd and Advanced Personal Computers Sdn Bhd were in fact shell companies with paid-up capital of RM2 each. The third company is Clearway Sdn. Bhd.Samy Vellu decided on the shares allocation – not the Ministry of Finance!On what criteria did Samy Vellu decide that the three companies deserve to get the Telekom shares instead of Maika?What business experience and success could these companies boast about to warrant their being chosen from among all the other Indian businesses in the country? Serious conflict of interestThere was a serious case of conflict of interest involved in this scandal. A director of Maika was also a shareholder and director of one of the three companies, all of which divided the nine million Telekom shares equally. Lim Kit Siang named this person as R Selvendra on May 7, 1992.Two of the three companies – Advance Personal Computers and SB Management Services – shared the same business address: Level 2, Block F-North, Damansara Town Centre, Damansara Heights, Kuala Lumpur.These two companies had the same company secretary: S. Balasubramaniam.Significantly, S Balasubramaniam and S Sothinathan were both directors and shareholders of these two companies.Note: Sothinathan is none other than the present MIC vice-president and MP for Teluk Kemang.Samy Vellu rewarded a person who helped him hijack the Telekom shares by making him a deputy minister and could also probably groom him for future leadership of MIC. Do we need leaders like this?If the 10 million STMB shares were allocated for the MIC, who would be the natural inheritors of these shares on behalf of the Indian community – Maika with its 66,400 shareholders or three insignificant private companies with six shareholders? Does this information in any way suggest that these three companies represented the interests of the Indian community?Who lied to the Finance Ministry that these “three companies represented the interests of the Indian community”?What was the motive for diverting nine million shares to three private companies?Those who sought to find the answers were threatened or beaten up. One brave soul who went on a crusade to expose this scandal was stabbed in Penang. Whenever questions regarding Maika were raised at MIC meetings presided by Samy Vellu, it was alleged that thugs would suddenly appear beside the person asking the question and that would be the end of the affair to seek answers.On May 13, 1992, the then Selangor assemblyman for Seri Cahaya S Sivalingam (now deceased), had also acted as a thug when he led an assault on Maika shareholders who were peacefully picketing against the Maika Telekom shares scandal outside the Maika headquarters.In October 2006, the MIC Johor assemblyman for Tenggaroh, the late S Krishnasamy assaulted M. Kulasegaran the DAP MP for Ipoh Barat at the Maika annual general meeting (AGM) at Legend Hotel. Even though Kulasegaran lodged a police report, no action was taken against Krishnasamy.Some years ago, it was claimed that at one particular MIC meeting at the Dewan Sri Pinang in Penang, chaired by Samy Vellu, a Maika shareholder wanted to know the position of Maika. It was alleged that Samy Vellu told this shareholder that he would provide the answer after the adjournment for refreshment. In the meantime two thugs confronted this shareholder and told him that if he wanted to return home in one piece it was the right time to go home. When the meeting resumed, Samy Vellu reportedly called for the shareholder to repeat his query. But since he wasn’t there, Samy Vellu continued with his meeting without touching on the subject of Maika.What is puzzling is the fact that in spite of so much overwhelming evidence, the Anti- Corruption Agency (ACA) after 17 months of investigation cleared Samy Vellu of any wrong-doing but unfortunately without clearing the doubts in the minds of the Malaysians.In 1994, the then chairman of MIC public claims committee, V Subramaniam – also known as Barat Maniam – made a startling public accusation. He charged that the accounts were fabricated to make it appear as if all the profits from the sale of Telekom shares were channelled to MIED. In challenging Samy to take him to court, he declared, “I have come out with this statement to prove that Samy Vellu is a thief. He has stolen (Telekom) shares from the Indian community.” Maika Scandal refuses to be buriedIn spite of 25 years of history, the Maika scandal refuses to be buried. It keeps on surfacing, haunting and hounding the perpetrators of a crime that robbed the poor of their fair share. The controversy surrounding the Maika-Telekom shares scandal appears to be far from over.Promises were made; time and again, that Maika shareholders will get their hard earned money back. But not a penny was paid. At each Maika annual general meeting, the shareholders continue to press for answers. Often the meeting degenerates into violence as ‘thugs’ linked to the MIC president rough up those who dare ask questions.Samy Vellu appointed his son Vell Paari as CEO of Maika Holdings in 1999. He is now in the process of selling off the few remaining assets of Maika Holdings.Samy Vellu is very much in control of MIC, and he runs the party as a feudal organisation where he makes all the decisions. He has systematically hounded many capable leaders out of MIC to maintain his iron grip in the party. His deputies and committee members are loyal minions who will not hesitate to do anything and everything he says. After years in power, MIC is now a rotting mass, particularly in the head. Instead of serving the Indian community, MIC has become a party that serves only its leaders while millions of Indians face untold misery. The poor Indians have remained poor while those close to Samy Vellu became rich beyond their own expectations.MIC exists for the benefit of its leaders, not the poor Indian community."

JimbeamofNRT,20170722,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 181,201209,,"In case you are being so ignorant.DAP’s explanation on why it is working with MahathirDAP has a problem trying to explain to the Chinese voters why it is working with Mahathir. For more than 30 years Kit Siang and DAP have been saying that Mahathir is evil. In that case why are Kit Siang and DAP working with an evil person? If DAP does not come out with a good explanation then it is going to lose a lot of Chinese votes. So, DAP’s explanation is that Mahathir is going to make Kit Siang the next Prime Minister.PAKATAN’S GAME OF THRONESRaja Petra KamarudinThere are about 45-46 seats with a Chinese majority. Maybe DAP can win 40 or so of those seats, even if 100% of the Chinese vote for DAP (which will never happen). So, to win more than 40 seats, DAP needs to be part of an opposition coalition and the Chinese votes must be about 90-95%, like what it was in 2013 when DAP’s seats jumped from 28 in 2008 to 38 in 2013. But then, if the Chinese reject DAP because of its collaboration with Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, then don’t talk about winning 40 seats because DAP’s seats may actually decline to just 30 or less.And this is DAP’s main worry. How to increase their 38 seats to 40 or more instead of seeing them decline to 30 or less because the Chinese are not happy with DAP’s collaboration with Mahathir. This is the same Mahathir of 1981. Mahathir has never changed. The Mahathir of today is still the same Mahathir of old. So why is DAP collaborating with Mahathir today when everything wrong with Malaysia was and is because of Mahathir?Kit Sing PMDAP’s explanation as to why it is working with Mahathir: because Mahathir is going to make Kit Siang the PMTo offset this problem DAP is embarking on a misinformation and deception campaign amongst the Chinese electorate by saying that DAP supports Mahathir because he has agreed to make Kit Siang the Prime Minister if Pakatan Harapan wins the next general election. They have even printed posters showing Kit Siang as the next Prime Minister with Mahathir as his Deputy.DAP’s politics has always been the Machiavellian politics of the end justifying the means. This is just like what Superman Hew Kuan Yau said: vote for a Malay candidate so that the Chinese can use the Malays to fight the Malays. And this is also what they said in 2008 and 2013: vote for PAS because the Chinese can use PAS to fight Umno. And now it is DAP must support Mahathir because Mahathir is going to make Kit Siang the next Prime Minister.zaid_ibrahim_dap_2Kit Siang will work with the devil as long as it suits his personal agenda (and helps keep his son out of jail)This way DAP does not need to justify why it is working with an evil and dastardly Mahathir. They can keep silent regarding Mahathir’s transgressions and misdeeds and tell the Chinese that Mahathir may be evil but then Mahathir is going to make Kit Siang the Prime Minister (Mahathir may be a bitch but he is our bitch). And to the Chinese this is a good reason to work with Mahathir, never mind how evil he may have been and still is.DAP’s proven track record is they say one thing but they do the opposite. 1990, 1995, 1999, 2004, 2008, and post-2013 events, have proven this. And this has become even more apparent of late with their collaboration with Mahathir. For more than 30 years since 1981 Kit Siang and DAP have condemned Mahathir and have accused him of all sorts of evil deeds and dastardly crimes. Now, suddenly, DAP appoints Mahathir the de facto leader of the opposition and Kit Siang stands behind Mahathir and backs him against every allegation being made.Hew-Kuan-Yau-DAP-SupermanUse Malays to fight Malays, use PAS to fight Umno, and use Mahathir to make Kit Siang the PMBut then these allegations were made by Kit Siang and/or DAP in the first place. This is just like Karpal Singh alleging that Anwar Ibrahim had committed sexual misconduct and sodomy and then embracing Anwar as the de facto opposition leader and, kononnya, a victim of fitnah. Hello…if in the first place Karpal had not raised the matter of Anwar’s sexual misconduct and sodomy Malaysians would have never known about it.So the same goes for Kit Siang. Since the 1980s he has made all sorts of exposes and allegations against Mahathir. Today, he embraces Mahathir as the opposition leader and partner of DAP. This is just like condemning PAS in 1990 and then going to bed with them in 1999, and then condemning PAS again in 2001 and going to bed with them again in 2008. DAP is a worse prostitute than those they are prostituting.--------------Somehow I agree with RPK on this article. my questions:a. So now what makes DAP is different from MCA?b. DAP should explain to the voters why they collaborate with Mahathir?"
