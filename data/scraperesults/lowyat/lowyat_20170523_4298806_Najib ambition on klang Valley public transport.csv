Kaerna,20170523,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 282,200802,,Reliability is above coverage...There's no point in having extensive coverage if there's no reliability.KTM is a fine example of that....I rather they fix the frequency and reliability issue of the current system before trying to expand and cause more problems.

happyking4ever,20170523,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 192,201502,,"mrt itself is not sufficient, it needs also proper feeder bus system so that many people can actually find mass transit useful. meanwhile, the cost of operating mass transit is a huge challenge, and to push the cost completely to passengers is not viable, the operator of mass transit needs foresight to collect other revenue through side income. otherwise you can have a huge mass transit system, but ticket price too high that people rather drive, bike, or uber."

In Australia and HK their buses is on time, according to time table they put on the bus stop sign.What is point of having full coverage if we cannot even hv our public transportation to come in time."
dangerminimouse,20170523,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 95,201609,,"Our walk ways is an embarrassment, so small and narrow, not for human to walk, some only 2 feet wide, for who to walk? Pygmies ah?I go to Japan, their walk way so big, until every jap got a car and bicycle. So many Japanese love to do jogging. Also their MRT stations got hundreds of bicycle parking facilities. We cant even improve on what we have, and we want wider services, I want to laugh."

Just look at KLIA 1, used to be world class, now the train always break down, even the travelators, then paint chip off, toilet like crap dirty - tourist want to pangsai also vomit."
