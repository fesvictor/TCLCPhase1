Any party that practice secrecy is full of shit. Party like this is a toothless tiger. Kata nak open transparency but cant even reveal who will be the next PM. Bodo. Just do debate among leaders , the one that shown its true colors in front of tv and get most votes shall proceed to national level. Problem is that most of them are not trained to debate in public. Just see how US candidates debated intellectually in public vicinity."

MaximtheGreat,20170623,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 1,201409,,"Pkr too scare to reveal their PM choice because they afraid their choice of the leader doesn't have the charisma and potential to lead a nation into a better state while Amanah, in front of the must vote for DAP leadership for PM candidate but in secret they want to support the PKR because they are malay based party which led by former leader DSAI. Pribumi confirm will voice their leaders as the choice of the PM candidate because they think the other 3 party member don't have the balls or charismatic like non other then former pm."
