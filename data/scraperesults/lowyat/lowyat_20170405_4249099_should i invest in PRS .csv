Avangelice,20170405,In Absolute Control,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 3,353",200806,From: Kuching (The Land of Opportunity),only reason for PRS is tax relief. don't bother if there isn't. no point locking down money until you are old
xtylish,20170405,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 475,200912,From: Malaysia,tax relief? i never file in malaysia before.
Avangelice,20170405,In Absolute Control,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 3,353",200806,From: Kuching (The Land of Opportunity),then dont bother with it. your Singapore CPF enough to replace retirement savings. if you really want to invest your monies open a fundsupermart Singapore account
