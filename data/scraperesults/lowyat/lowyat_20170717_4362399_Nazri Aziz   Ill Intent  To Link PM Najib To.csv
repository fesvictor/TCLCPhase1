So they mention the Malaysian Official One (MO1).“(But) who the hell is MO1? Tell me. How can you charge somebody in court if that person is not identified,” he told a press conference here.Another Umno minister Abdul Rahman Dahlan last year told British media network BBC that MO1 was Najib.Asked about Rahman’s remark, Nazri said, “as far as we know, MO1 is nobody”.“Even that (Rahman saying Najib is MO1) is just speculation. It’s not factual.”Nazri offered a theory on why the DoJ opted to use the term MO1 instead of directly naming the person concerned.“I want to ask, why mention MO1? Why not mention Najib Razak? Because there is not enough evidence. Let me tell you, in America if there is enough evidence, they will charge.”The DoJ has filed two civil forfeiture lawsuits against assets worth US$1.8 billion (RM7.7 billion) that it claimed were bought with funds stolen from Malaysia’s state-owned 1MDB.The suits comprised the largest legal action brought under the DoJ’s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.The first suit was filed on July 21 last year in which the term MO1 was mentioned 36 times.MO1 was again mentioned in the second suit filed in June this year, which claimed Malaysian businessman Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low, had purchased a 22-carat pink diamond necklace worth US$27.3 million for the wife of MO1, using money from the same source.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...b-embezzlement/"

gladfly,20170717,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 466,201003,,Don't be stupid.. The reason Doj did not name MO1 is because MO1 did not launder or bought anything in US. Those named all kena because they bought assets in US. Had MO1 was silly enough to buy anything in US.. I bet doj would have named himBut the fact remains that he is connected to the named since money's flowed through his account and eventually ended in buying  g US assets
