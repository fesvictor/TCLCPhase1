Muhammad Nur Hanief,20170506,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 555,200602,"From: Malaysia, UNITED STATES OF ASIA","How much can a 21 years old flat chested amoi pay to all the victim? Even if she prostitute herself in order to cover the losses still it cannot match the value or each victim? Can you set a price tag of each victim? They are not Mackerel dishes to begin with. They are priceless. Normally when you lost your priceless one, what you do? You set a price tag? No! You forgive and forget and stay away from stupid friends. Remind your children to choose the right friend. If they have to be lonely because of no good friends around, it is your duty to find a good neighborhood for your children to mix around and develop their character. You don't just have sex and let loose. Marriage ain't like that. It is a responsibility. If kampung is suitable for your children upbringing, move to kampung. The beloved Prophet MPBUH also was brought up in a kampung environment, fresh air, less stress, fresh food, big land, lovely people and most importantly cheaper."
