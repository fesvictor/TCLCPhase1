Around 18 is perfect. At this age many wimmen has early adulthood crisis and usually tend to latch onto matured older guys as a leader figure. (But you also must be ripe with wisdom at that age laaa). Girls aged 23 above usually already have her own head and a bit hard to 'convince'. Girls at the age I said are just 'exploring' her new options and baru nak kenal dunia, so easy to guide.Older girls that are more 'established' usually channels her own preference to a certain type of guys. If u not that type, gg lo. Younger girls usually don't really know what they want, so u can pandai pandai convince.Also by that age, you shouldn't be awkward around people anymore. At least get some smooth talking done and learn to make good conversation. Learn from banglas, they're apparently good at conversation.Sos: People around me"
