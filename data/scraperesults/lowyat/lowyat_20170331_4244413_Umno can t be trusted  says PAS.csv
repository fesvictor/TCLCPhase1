Einjahr,20170331,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 14,201012,,"UMNO is untrustworthy, says a senior PAS leader, after its president, and Prime Minister Najib Razak, went back on his word to adopt the Islamist party’s private member’s bill that would have enhanced punishments for shariah offences.“This is proof that Umno cannot be relied on to defend Islam. They are not even brave enough to table RUU355,” said an incensed and disappointed PAS vice-president Iskandar Abdul Samad.On December 2, 2016, Najib said the government would take over the bill, first tabled by PAS president and Marang MP Abdul Hadi Awang.The bill, known by its Bahasa Malaysia acronym RUU355, was to amend the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1965 (Act 355) Bill, which capped punishments for shariah offences at a three-year jail term, RM5,000 fine and six lashes of the cane.In the latest version of the bill, shariah punishments have been enhanced to a maximum 30 years’ jail, RM100,000 fine and 100 lashes.On March 29, Najib said the government will not be adopting RUU355 and that it would remain a private member’s bill.This means is likely to be pushed back down the agenda of the current Dewan Rakyat sitting which ends on April 6.In responding to the development, Iskandar said this has been the weakest BN administration in history.“To all you Umno members, what are you waiting for?” said Iskandar in a Facebook posting.Selangor PAS Youth information chief Ahmad Hakimi Othman said Umno’s rejection of RUU 355 would have negative consequences.“The decision goes against the proposal by the Deputy Prime Minister (Ahmad Zahid Hamidi),” Ahmad Hakimi wrote on PAS mouth piece Harakahdaily.On March 18, Zahid said the BN government would table RUU355 as its own in the first Dewan Rakyat sitting of the year, which runs until April 6.Zahid’s proposal had been supported by PAS secretary-general Takiyuddin Hassan, who felt that it should have been taken up by the government all along.“Maybe this is a chance to replace Najib if the threats by MCA, MIC and Gerakan cannot be ignored?sos“Will this lead to another purge in Umno?” Hakimi wrote, referring to BN’s non-Malay component party members who had been protesting against Hadi’s bill since 2015.UPDATED : Since some PAS supporters butthurt cannot accept reality this time from NST Online"

PAS is all open for anyone who willing to table RUU355 into parliment, especially federal gomen..""u want help us to table it? thanks, by all mean, please do it, we fully support it""..PAS didnt lose this battle..they have won it actually..they send bola tanggung to UMNO, to see how brave UMNO is to bring it into parliment..& UMNO raise white flagso now PAS will still pursuit for private bill (as PAS can only make private bill) for RUU355, & its up to speaker & MPs in parliment to decide..speaker allow it, then its a bola tanggung to all muslim MPs & non-Muslim MPs, Muslim MPs escpecially regardless any party..their vote to support or reject RUU355 amendment will determine their future in the eyes of majority Malay Muslim voters for next GE they know they cant capture putrajaya..so they focus to do things that focus on malay muslim"
Einjahr,20170401,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 14,201012,,"I want to see how far these two clown parties can keep it Islam before  the ""melayu' bit gets to their heads. Its interesting to watch so many layers upon layers of hypocrisy in action yet the 'Islamic Party' turns a blind eye on them. I just love it how you to take MPs to task challenging them to decide on RUU35 amendment to determine their fate before the Malay Muslim voters in the next GE. How much more evidence you need to realise that conservatism will only spell the end of Malaysia's progress and development. PAS seems hell-bent in turning the whole country into Kelantan, never-mind their dismal record in managing their own state."
