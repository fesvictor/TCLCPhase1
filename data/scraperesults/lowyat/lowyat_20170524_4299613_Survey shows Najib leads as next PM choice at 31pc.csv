clydefrog,20170524,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 22,201302,,How sad it that we don't have a single politician capable of leading this country. The people realize it as well none of these donkeys are fit to lead but our choices in the next election are between the devil and the deep blue sea.Malaysias greatest weakness has always been poor leadership and that is not going to change anytime soon.
