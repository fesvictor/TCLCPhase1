Both countries will jointly award the tender for a Joint Development Partner for the HSR project, which is expected to cost up to RM50 billion.Mahathir was not completely negative towards the HSR. He said if feasible, the HSR could even be expanded to Penang or up to the Thai border.“All these things need to be studied carefully and to know what would be the returns on the investment. We accept that we will lose money at first but how much over how long a period,” said Mahathir, the Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia chairman.It was under his tenure that the Light Rail Transit (LRT) was built, so referring to that he said: “We built the LRT and lost a lot of money in the beginning but now it is so crowded that we have to add more trains.”In the interview, Mahathir also said Singapore shouldn’t worry if the government led by Prime Minister Najib Razak falls, despite the close ties Najib has built with Singapore.He said Malaysia and Singapore always found ways to resolve any issues in a peaceful manner. But he did warn that if anything could drive a wedge between Singapore and Malaysia, it would be China, whose relations with Singapore have become tense.He argued that might force Najib to distance himself from Singapore. “If we have a lot of Chinese investment in Malaysia, they will want to secure their investment and influence the Malaysian government to help them whatever way we can.”“They will want to make sure that we do not side with Singapore in any dispute with China,” he said, adding that Najib had only been “friendly” towards Singapore because he was in a politically weak position and needed projects like the 350km HSR to boost his standing in Malaysia.Recently, Mahathir has been a loud critic of the sale of land to Chinese developers in Johor’s Iskandar region and the nature of Chinese developments in the country.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...igh-speed-rail/"

If not, we would've get a straight bridge with water flowing underneath it. Crooked bridge was designed to that small vassel could pass under it without resorting to use a draw-bridge system. But at the rate of land reclamation there, might as well reclaim the whole strait and once and for all join Johor with Singapore with 100 foot wall in-between."
