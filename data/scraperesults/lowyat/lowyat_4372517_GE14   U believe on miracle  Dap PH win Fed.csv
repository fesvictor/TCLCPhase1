Maotze,07/28/17,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,1 Jul 2017,,miracle wont happen but if oppo at last minute can have a deal and able to get support from Pas than only magic will happen. Who can get Pas support will win the GE as a big pool of malay voters coming from Pas supporters. Very sad reality actually but what to do since a lot of malay supporting Pas. That is the reason why Umno jilat kuat Pas lately.

No point toppling a corrupt regime just to be replaced by a regime that will push the country into religious extremism that is EVEN WORSE.

Singaporean economy is really worrying.I work in MNC and I can tell you most MNC is expanding their KL office and downsizing Singapore due to cost concern.
