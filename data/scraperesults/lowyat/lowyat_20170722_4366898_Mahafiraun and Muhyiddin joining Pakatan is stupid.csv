After all, this is the man who proposed Najib's worst policies like PPSMI abolishment. Why should any progressive urban parent agree to this?Wouldn't Wan Azizah and Anwar agreeing to have Mahathir and Muhyddin in Pakatan make both of them look like desperate fools who are willing to deal with the devil just to win seats instead of being an actual opposition? What happens if they lose seats because of this? Wouldn't it make Anwar and Wan Azizah look out of touch and stupid? Not only that, but doesn't this add more salt to the wounds from Kajang Move? Are they really this fucking stupid?And Rafizi has the balls to say that Pakatan can ""win"" in GE14? Don't they learn anything from Hillary Clinton?"

Think logically Chinese are 25% of the electorate there is no way they can win an election without Malay partners. At best they are sharing power 50-50 with non Chinese parties. You consider that screwing? Even if PH lose this election there will always be enough people who want change. Without the racial issues constantly being played up by BN we would have changed government long ago. In some ways it's a shame malaysia is so multiracial it gives BN an easy card to play.

Secularism in a definition is using brain power to get hard data instead of just doing what you believe should be done to do something.PH is one of those closet racist like bush instead of open racist like trump. You'll know they are racist just from the way they talk. Ok they have both. LKS is the former while mamakthir is the latter.It's really hard to say they are pro science  when they against any favorible statistics that show the country in good light. Claimed lower taxes will benefits the middle class in a very classic trumpcare moves. Claimed the country going bankrupt and only they can make it great again. Claimed every news they didn't like as fake news. Hates foreigners so much. Claimed voter fraud when they didn't win. Claimed everything they opponents did as a disaster.Yeah. It's is really easy to find them as pro science liberal and not totally far right like trump.

If Scumno scumbags don't disintegrate Malaysia will be own by Tongsan and the rakyats will pay this debt through their nose. Look at the ECRL!

Port Klang and Kuantan Port could benefit.... creating new strategic asset to the East Coast long neglegted by Mahathir regime...Couple with Central Spine Road and ECE 1 & 2 ... transportation wise, life has been much better for east coast states..Since we have suffered under cronyism model, I dont mind giving FDI model a try.... since this is high social impact project when the gov dont really has much penny to spare..Either tongsan help us create the ECRL land bridge or the help thailand to build the segenting kra canal that by pass malaysia, singapore or indonesia altogetther.."

I think it will be a safe and faster alternative compare to busses and cheapet ans less hussle to aeroplane..

If those in power always remain in power means you have no leverage.Your logic is screwed.
