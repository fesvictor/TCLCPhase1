And well, if there is no other candidate, I have to contest… be it in Pekan or anywhere. But must win lah.“I want to contest to win, not to lose,” he told reporters when met at the Raya open house hosted by DAP’s Zaid Ibrahim here today.The 92-year-old, who is also PPBM chairman, said that he would like to “have some say” in the PH government, if they make it to Putrajaya after GE14.“I would like to put forward some ideas before the new government, and see whether they work or not,” the former prime minister said, adding that the ideas he had in mind dealt with the management of the country’s finances.Najib was first elected to the Pekan seat in 1976, when he was only 23 years old. Prior to that, the seat was held by Najib’s father and second prime minister, Abdul Razak Hussein, who passed away while in office in January 1976.Najib has been Pekan MP since, except for the period between 1982 and 1986. In the 1982 general election, Najib ran for a state seat and became Pahang menteri besar for one term.Despite the strong fight put up by the opposition, Najib has always come out victorious. In the last general election (GE13), he defeated PKR candidate Mohd Fariz Musa with a majority of 35,613 votes.However, Mahathir has previously been reported as saying that Najib won the seat in 1999 by the slimmest of margins thanks to late votes from Orang Asli and army personnel.“In 1999, when he almost lost in Pekan, he resorted to bringing in Orang Asli people and soldiers, and they were forced to support him. As a result, he won with just 200 votes,” Mahathir reportedly said at a ceramah organised by PPBM in February this year.Meanwhile, PPBM’s supreme council member Anina Saadudin and former Umno man Ezam Mohd Nor, have also expressed their intention to take on Najib in Pekan.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...najib-in-pekan/"

Once again the only way this will stop is when we change government because you can be damn sure they will be back at some point = clean elections finally.

Mikethebodo,20170724,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 26,201706,,"not necessarily, a lot of voters have rejected pas in the past. They are lot like Kelantan undying loyalty. Just like Trengganu voters, they know how to punish the state gomen if they don't respond to voter needs. but u r right, Mamakthir may no longer have the support anymore. People here look to people with power. If the person no longer have the power, they will not support."

LamTin,20170726,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201010,,Yes abit risky but this old guy reli experience n strong n smart. He is correct most importantly is to win! Or else no point contesting. If he can beat najib in pekan then najib cannot become prime minister anymore n will malukan his late dad alot! But if dr m loses it also will be a shame. But lks also can defeat past johor mb in gelang patah. Anything is possible though. They need to put strong strategy to win it. Malaysian many are ignorant. Need different strategy in different places...
