In Perlis, a woman was seen being lifted on a stretcher after she became unwell.Malaysiakini also found that a Kelantan state leader requested the government to allow them to hand out BR1M manually. The state, however, has yet to organise an event to deliver the fund ...For the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year. If you're already a subscriber, please sign in."
