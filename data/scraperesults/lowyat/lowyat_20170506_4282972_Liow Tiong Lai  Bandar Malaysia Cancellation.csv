The other party failed to make the payments in time so the landowner has the right to cancel the deal and find a new partner.“It has nothing to do with political relations between China and Malaysia,” the Transport Minister told reporters after giving a brief motivational talk to students at a tuition class at Pahang MCA building here.He added that the Government takes the Bandar Malaysia project very seriously and will not allow it to fail.“This is a very precious piece of land, we cannot afford to delay the development schedule.“It would affect the development of the entire Bandar Malaysia,” he said.Liow also dismissed talk that the cancelled deal would negatively affect political relations between China and Malaysia.“We’ll visit China next week and meet the Chinese leaders,” he said.Meanwhile, Liow said Pahang MCA is planning to install a lift for its five-storey building at Jalan Tan Sri Chan Siang Sun.He spoke to about 50 Form Four and Form Five students who were attending a free weekly tuition class on physics and additional mathematics at the building this morning.The Bentong MP encouraged the students to study hard to do well academically but also pay attention to building their social skills to ensure they do well in life.“Participate in sports and social activities to build your human relation, leadership and management skills. You cannot learn these from books.“Strengthen your language skills. All these skills will be useful when you enter society and the workforce.“I was not an A student and I could not really speak well in school but now I’m a politician.“I built my confidence by participating in activities in school and in university,” said Liow.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...IuUofC1CYMQD.99"
