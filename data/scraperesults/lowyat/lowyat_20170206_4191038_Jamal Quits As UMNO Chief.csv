He and nine others were arrested a few days ago for alleged gang robbery.This came after he led a series of raids on gaming centres in the state in a bid to highlight what he claimed was the Selangor government’s lack of enforcement against illegal gambling outlets.“I’m giving up all the important posts to focus on running illegal gambling joints as owners of such premises seem to be above the law,” he said in a rather cynical tone.Jamal addressed his supporters in a short video, which was uploaded on Facebook.The businessman is well known for his headline-grabbing antics.Just last month, he parked 10 beds outside the Selangor secretariat building to highlight what he claimed was a mushrooming of massage parlours in the state.In December, Jamal walked to the Selangor state secretariat building in nothing but a towel to protest the massive water cuts in the Klang Valley.The month before that, he organised a helicopter ride above a bungalow belonging to Ampang PKR Youth chief Adam Rosly, questioning his “extraordinary” wealth.Sos : FMT"

He started well, most likely appreciated by PM but he continued to do many silly things that turned him to become a liability of PM. He has gone overboard and PM doesn't want to take risk protecting this man anymore since the election is coming.Soon he is going to be like Khir Toyo, forgotten UMNO leaders."
