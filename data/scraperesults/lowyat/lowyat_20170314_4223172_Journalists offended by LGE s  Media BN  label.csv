Lim should not label the media who covered the press conference as Media BN.“This tarnishes the image of the media and its freedom,” he added.The association today also contacted Liou, who announced his resignation on Sunday.Liou confirmed that there was indeed 182 DAP members who had handed in their resignation letters and the letters have since been sent to DAP’s headquarters through PosLaju as of 4pm yesterday."

The video has since gone viral on social media.He also said the money was channelled through Affin Bank.Tuan Ibrahim said the party’s lawyer had been told to review the allegations made by Husam before proceeding with legal action."

Actually Media BN is a correct label since the press is owned by political parties in Malaysia... they can't deny that fact.Mustapha Kamil pretty much revealed that the editors-in-chief in mainstream media has no freedom anyways."
