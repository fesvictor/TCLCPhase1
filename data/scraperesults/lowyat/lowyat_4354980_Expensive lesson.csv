I found a supplier during visit in Taiwan. In later year, while digging in internet, found another supplier which sell cheaper for same product. I could save RM200 more I think per every batch order. End up with losing RM 8k kena scam."

tareh,"  Jul 11 2017, 03:58 PM",Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 126,Joined: Apr 2008,,"renovate home. contractor was recommended by a friend, say good good. first time renovate home i dont know shit. was quoted 14k for toilet retiled and new berak place and vinyl flooring. bila dah siap, toilet takde waterprofing, bocor to downstairs neighbor. the vinyl flooring not ikut specs, say 8mm but i get 4mm so you can see the old tiles underneath. finishing fail. used my tangga until rosak.so lesson learnt: ask around, sure friends have done similar renovation ask for pricing, then most important press the contractor to list down the price line by line - including how much are every single tiles cost + installation"
