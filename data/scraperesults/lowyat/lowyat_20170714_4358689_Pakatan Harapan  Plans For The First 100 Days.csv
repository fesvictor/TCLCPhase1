TigerLion,20170715,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201702,,"Lol.   PH is out to sabo all Malaysians!   Taking away GST, when it is not applicable to many basic necessities like in SG, is shifting the tax burden from foreigners to locals and from the rich to the poor.   Other subsidies need to be paid for by more public money. Why do Malaysians like subsidy so much? Buy only what you can afford and leave the subsidies for those who are really poor."
TigerLion,20170715,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201702,,"The two term rule shows the stupidity of PH.   Why put such stupid restrictions on yourself?   If a leader is capable, like PM Najib, he should be allowed to run the country as long as he can and wants.   Look at what happened to DAP...   If DAP didn't have this 2-term rule, LGE will just hold another CEC election and kill the allegation of foul play straight away."
wotvr,20170715,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 5,201206,,"Meh. End up you abolish GST and replace with something worse and inefficient. I doubt they'll even abolish GST.If they don't splinter into warring factions after winning the election, their pledges aren't plausible anyway. High probability is that they'll be more corrupt than BN to secure their war chest in preparation for next election with cash rich BN if they win this time.Seems that Malaysia got no decent choices in this election. The douche you know very well and the turd you don't plus the man who brought us into this mess."
