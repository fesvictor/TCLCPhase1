joe_mamak,20170329,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/377270MalaysiaKiniRafizi: Campur tangan menteri sebabkan Petronas bayar lebih mahal?Shakira Buang     28 Mac 2017Naib Presiden PKR, Rafizi Ramli hari ini mempersoalkan sama ada campur tangan Menteri di Jabatan Perdana Menteri, Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan menyebabkan Petronas terpaksa membayar harga minyak mentah dari Saudi Aramco dengan harga lebih mahal.Rafizi berkata, ini kerana dalam laporan Reuters sebelum ini dengan jelas menyebut bahawa sumbernya menyebut Saudi Aramco menyatakan keputusan menggantung penyertaannya dibuat setelah mereka mendapati pulangan pelaburan yang tidak mencukupi.""Ini bermakna salah satu punca utama kenapa tidak ada persetujuan di antara Petronas dan Saudi Aramco sebelum campur tangan Datuk Seri Najib (Razak) dan Datuk Seri Abdul Rahman Dahlan adalah berkisar mengenai kadar keuntungan pelaburan yang ditetapkan oleh Saudi Aramco yang mungkin tidak dipersetujui oleh Petronas,"" kata Rafizi dalam sidang medianya di Parlimen hari ini.Mengulas lanjut, Rafizi yang juga anggota parlimen Pandan itu berkata rakyat perlu memahami bahawa perjanjian yang ditandatangani oleh Petronas dan Saudi Aramco melibatkan persetujuan untuk membekalkan minyak mentah yang menjadi bahan asas untuk ditapis dan diproses di kompleks penapisan minyak dan petrokimia (Rapid) di Penggerang.""Ini bermakna, Petronas bersetuju membeli dan Saudi Aramco bersetuju membekalkan minyak mentah bagi satu tempoh jangka masa panjang pada satu harga yang formulanya telah dipersetujui terlebih awal tertakluk kepada turun naik harga minyak mentah dunia.""Selalunya harga minyak mentah yang dibeli melalui perjanjian pembekalan jangka panjang sebegini melibatkan diskaun pada nilai tertentu yang ditolak dari harga rujuk minyak mentah Brent bergantung kepada mutu minyak mentah tersebut,"" kata Rafizi.Dadik dadaOleh itu, Rafizi berkata kebimbangan beliau kini berkisar laporan Reuters dan kenyataan Abdul Rahman yang mendabik dada bahawa campur tangan beliau telah “menyelamatkan” penyertaan Saudi Aramco sekali gus mempersoalkan kemampuan menteri kerajaan itu.""Sebab itu saya kata Abdul Rahman bukanlah seorang yang ada pengalaman dengan projek-projek sebegini dan beliau tidak sedar dengan membuka mulut seperti itu, beliau memberi gambaran ada campur tangan pihak kerajaan dalam rundingan komersil yang menentukan pulangan pelaburan kepada Petronas dan Saudi Aramco,"" kata Rafizi.Semalam, Rafizi menggesa Abdul Rahman menjelaskan peranan sebenar beliau dalam 'menyelamatkan' perjanjian pelaburan bernilai AS$7 bilion (RM31 billion) antara Petronas dan Saudi Aramco.Pada sidang medianya itu, Rafizi merujuk kepada kenyataan Abdul Rahman yang dilaporkan pada Sabtu lalu bahawa beliau berada di tempat dan masa yang betul apabila rundingan perjanjian itu tidak berjalan seperti dirancang.Oleh demikian, Rafizi sekali lagi mendesak Abdul Rahman untuk berbuat demikian.""Saya masih lagi menunggu jawapan Abdul Rahman mengenai peranan sebenar yang dimainkan serta bahagian khusus di dalam perjanjian usahasama diantara Petronas dengan Saudi Aramco di dalam projek Rapid yang telah beliau campuriDua hari yang lalu, Abdul Rahman mendedahkan peranan beliau dalam perjanjian pelaburan bernilai AS$7 bilion dengan Saudi Aramco setelah ia tidak berjalan seperti dirancang.Abdul Rahman berkata, Perdana Menteri Datuk Seri Najib Razak mengarahkan beliau ke Riyadh pada akhir 2016 selepas rundingan perjanjian itu, yang telah berlangsung selama kira-kira dua tahun, berjalan dengan perlahan."

PappyBoyington,20170329,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"Good morning YB! RAFIZI ALLEGATION 1: Petronas does not need partners or brings in partners after they have started a project.This is untrue. Petronas brings in partners at various stages of the project - before, during or even after the project starts. Surely Rafizi knows this as this has always been Petronas' practice.The Gumusut-Kakap field is is 33% owned by Sabah Shell. Partners include ConocoPhillips Sabah (33%), Petronas Carigall (20%) and Murphy Oil (14%).Petronas's massive Canada project is majority-owned by PETRONAS together with minority partners Sinopec, JAPEX, Indian Oil Corporation and PetroleumBRUNEI.All companies evaluate whether to allow new partners to come in depending on what the partner brings to the project. Petronas is no exception and they will evaluate what additional benefits the potential partner brings to them.In the case of the RAPID project, Petronas has been inviting Saudi Aramco to join in the project even from 2 years ago as having Aramco in would mean assurance in oil supplies and increasing the confidence of other potential investors in the Pengerang project.RAFIZI ALLEGATION 2: The project was initially calculated to have insufficient returns for Aramco to justify investment. Hence, Petronas will have to increase the price for oil that it will buy from Aramco in order to make it attractive for Aramco to invest.Perhaps Rafizi does not understand that proper investors in multi-billion projects take into account country risk and political risk when they calculate their investment returns.They use sophisticated tools such as Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) or they do Discounted Cash Flow analysis using weighted average cost of capital (WACC).Both of these tools takes into account country and political risk.If the risk of both are high then the calculated returns are low.In the case of the RAPID and Pengerang project, I am sure Aramco had taken into account that DAP had successfully sabotaged a similar RM35 billion investment from Taiwan in Pengerang before.And worse, Aramco would probably take into account PKR's declaration that they will cancel the entire Pengerang project if they win power.Not to mention the numerous negative propaganda that says Malaysia is going bankrupt.All these adds to the ""Country and Political Risk Premiums"" which reduces the viability and attractiveness of any investments.If Rahman Dahlan was able to convince them that Country and Political Risk is not that high and that Pakatan are really a bunch of idiots with little hope of winning and cancelling the project then the projected returns of the project will immediately increase and be more viable for Aramco."

AFAIK refinery price has to follow market price which Singapore future market has data of it.Petronas always seek for partnership in every venture, main purpose is to diverse risk. With the shale oil coming, US has reduce import of crude oil from Saudi. Saudi oil has to sell to somewhere else to compete with Russia and Iran (US remove sanction recently). This investment is sort of win-win situation for Aramco and Petronas for what i think."

This is the reason why Saudi King visit China, Indonesia and Malaysia to seal the deal. In business world changes can be fast, last time could be not feasible to Saudi, but now it is win-win for both parties."
