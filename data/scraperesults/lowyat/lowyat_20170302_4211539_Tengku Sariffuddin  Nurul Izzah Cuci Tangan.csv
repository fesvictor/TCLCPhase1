Kerinchi yang lama.Setiausaha Akhbar kepada Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Tengku Sariffuddin Tengku Ahmad, kesal dengan sikap Ahli Parlimen Lembah Pantai, Nurul Izzah Anwar dalam isu 35 keluarga terlepas peluang mendapat rumah baharu di Kerinchi.Kata beliau, Nurul Izzah kini bukan sekadar 'cuci tangan' terhadap nasib penduduk yang menentang Projek Residensi Kerinchi, malah kini menyalahkan tindakan mereka berbuat demikian.Tengku Sariffuddin berkata, anggota parlimen itu juga tidak bersimpati terhadap mereka yang terkesan dengan hasutannya sebelum ini.""Tidak ada sepatah perkataan pun yang tertulis memberi jalan penyelesaian, tidak ada secoret pun simpati kepada mereka yang terkesan hasil tindakan beliau, jauh sekali mengakui kesilapan yang telah beliau lakukan,"" katanya dalam satu kenyataan di sini hari ini.Projek Residensi Kerinchi yang menempatkan 472 isi rumah dirasmikan Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak Isnin lepas.Bagaimanapun, 35 keluarga (penduduk Flat Empat Tingkat Kampung Kerinchi itu) tidak menandatangani perjanjian projek berkenaan sebelum ini.Najib ketika berucap pada majlis perasmian residensi itu melahirkan rasa musykilnya terhadap tindakan Nurul Izzah yang dilihat cuba menggagalkan projek itu sebelum ini.""Akhirnya mangsa 35 keluarga mengikut hasutannya (Nurul Izzah). Dan sekarang mereka menyesal kerana tidak dapat rumah baharu,"" kata Perdana Menteri.Perdana Menteri ketika berucap pada majlis perasmian itu berkata, penduduk yang menerima baik projek kerajaan itu kini mampu tinggal di pangsapuri berkeluasan 900 kaki persegi yang kondusif dengan dilengkapi kolam renang, surau, taman permainan dan sebagainya tanpa sebarang bayaran berdasarkan konsep 'trade-off' (tukar ganti).Residensi Kerinchi menempatkan 472 unit apartmen dibangunkan di kawasan lebih 2.8 hektar atas tapak bekas Flat Empat Tingkat, Kampung Kerinchi itu, yang diruntuhkan.Nurul Izzah ketika membalas komen Najib, sebaliknya dilaporkan menggesa Perdana Menteri supaya menghormati hak penduduk dan memberhentikan kenyataan berbaur 'fitnah' serta tidak menyakiti hati mereka.""Realitinya, beliau adalah penghasut. Bertahun lamanya beliau menentang kerajaan dan menghasut rakyat membantah projek yang hanya akan bawa kebaikan kepada mereka,"" tambah Tengku Sariffuddin. - BERNAMAhttp://www.utusan.com.my/berita/nasional/n...densi-kerinchi-"

azhan82,20170302,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 240,201505,From: Klang Valley,"For some background, the following is the chronology of events leading to the Kg Kerinchi’s controversy: 1) Dec 7 2009: Federal Territories and Urban Wellbeing Minister Datuk Raja Nong Chik Raja Zainal Abidin announced the Kg Kerinchi redevelopment plan. Raja Nong Chik said if a unanimous decision could be reached, the occupants would be relocated to the Kerinchi and Chempaka people’s housing scheme flats to make way for the redevelopment project. 2) March 27 2010:  The briefing on the redevelopment of the Kampung Kerinchi flats in Kuala Lumpur and the selection of the developer was conducted by the Federal Territories and Urban Wellbeing Ministry. 3) March 29 2010: The Suez Domain development company was selected to develop the Kampung Kerinchi flats in Pantai Dalam. 4) August 28 2011: Issues surrounding the redevelopment of the Kampung Kerinchi flats in Pantai Dalam is expected to be resolved by the end of the year. The flats were earmarked for redevelopment under the urban renewal scheme. 5) March 12, 2012: The first notice to vacate the premises was issued to residents but it was extended to March 26 to allow residents to sort out their relocation and PPR units. 6) April 2 2012: Raja Nong Chik said the notice to vacate for the remaining 35 families of the Kampung Kerinchi low-cost flat will not be extended as it has past the grace period extension given to the families to look for temporary accommodation while waiting for their new homes to be completed.7) April 3 2012: Kuala Lumpur City Hall allowed the remaining families to have another week to move out. The families had defied an eviction order to vacate the flats and following this a commotion broke out at the site when the demolition team arrived.  Student activist Adam Adli was punched by an unknown man during the commotion.  Lembah Pantai MP Nurul Izzah  who was present at the site negotiated on behalf of the residents for the Federal Territory Land and Mines Office to allocate time for residents to move out. 8) April 4 2012: In a press statement by Nurul Izzah, she raised several points regarding the redevelopment of Kampung Kerinchi which included wrongful use of power, improper procedures, and the use of physical threats in the redevelopment project. 9) April 5 2012: The remaining 35 families who initially refused to move out received keys to their homes at Kerinchi and Chempaka people’s housing schemes flat. Raja Nong Chik also said refuted allegations by Nurul Izzah, calling it baseless and politically motivated. On Nurul Izzah’s claim that the use of a referendum to select a developer was against the regulations, Raja Nong Chik stressed that the government was merely acting as a facilitator to ensure a smooth redevelopment process as most residents had expressed willingness for the redevelopment project to take place. 10) April 9 2012: After more than two years, the 35 families finally moved out to the people's housing scheme flats in Puchong and Pantai Dalam. - The Molehttp://malaysiansmustknowthetruth.blogspot...hall-never.htmlIn another follow up post, the blogger alleged Nurul Izzah was responsible in instigating the residents from moving out to get higher compensation amounting to RM 600,000.http://malaysiansmustknowthetruth.blogspot...hall-never.htmlAyam wonder, how much compensation those 35 families receive instead of the new house..."

My guess is they own it...It was a mess due to it being ordered by UMNO Lembah Pantai. My guess, money changed hand.. As always...  Now residents also own it. Value just up. KL, obviously after 5 years....Value laa.. I can value a pile of dirt half a million. Doesnt mean you can sell it for 500k...New residence should be happy lo... Become half a millionaire from low cost poorfag Antara keistimewan yang diperolehi oleh 408 penduduk flat ini adalah:1. Berbanding kediaman sebelum ini yang hanya mempunyai sebuah bilik atau tiada bilik, kini menjadi tiga bilik tidur serta dua bilik air. 2. Antara kemudahan yang disediakan termasuk surau, medan selera, taman permainan, taska, dewan serba guna dan kolam renang.3. Sebelum ini flat itu hanya mempunyai empat tingkat tetapi kini dibangunkan semula sebagai pangsapuri moden 18 tingkat.4. Dianggarkan nilai sebuah pangsapuri Residensi Kerinchi bernilai RM500,000, jauh berbeza dengan satu unit flat yang didiami penduduk terdahulu iaitu sekitar RM50,000.5. Penghuni baru itu turut menerima skim yang membantu mereka sebelum berpindah ke rumah baru, antaranya elaun pindah keluar ke rumah transit di PPR Kerinchi sebanyak RM5,000 dan pindah masuk ke Residensi Kerinchi sebanyak RM8,000.6. Kediaman ini sepatutnya siap pada Mac 2016. Sejumlah RM1,250 sebulan untuk tempoh lapan bulan diberikan kepada bakal penghuni disebabkan kelewatan projek.7. Bantuan persekolahan, mengangkut barang berpindah dan kenduri kendara turut dibantu oleh Pemaju kepada penghuni yang terlibat ketika mendiami di rumah transit selama enam tahun.Read more at http://khairulryezal.blogspot.com/2017/02/...ViirDFkAfykC.99   1 year delay....
