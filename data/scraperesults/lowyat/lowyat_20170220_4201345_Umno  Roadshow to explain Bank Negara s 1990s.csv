Coup De Grace,20170220,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,201611,,"KUALA LUMPUR: Umno and Barisan Nasional (BN) component parties will be going on a nationwide roadshow to inform the public about the special task force set up by the Cabinet to probe Bank Negara Malaysia’s (BNM) foreign exchange trading losses in the 1990s.Umno information chief Annuar Musa said the roadshow, scheduled to start on Feb 25, was mooted following attempts by certain parties to question the need for a task force and asking why the 1MDB issue was not given the same treatment.“The issue on the forex losses is important because it was not fully investigated before this even though it involved a large sum of money.“Why was the special team formed and why wasn’t one set up for 1MDB? This will all be explained in the roadshow by Umno and BN,” he told a press conference after chairing the Umno information working committee meeting here yesterday.On Feb 15, the Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement saying a special task force comprising representatives of government agencies including distinguished individuals with experience in various fields would be set up to probe the losses.The statement said the formation of the special team was also the first step to retrieve relevant facts such as analysing Hansard documents of Parliamentary meetings at the time, minutes of Cabinet meetings, the then auditor-general and BNM reports as well as those from other agencies.Annuar said BNM’s forex losses was different from the 1MDB issue because the 1MDB was an entity which had gone through an investigation and it was only a company.“It is different from the losses suffered by Bank Negara as it involved public funds. This special team set up by the Cabinet will identify the parties responsible and why it happened.“The government will also provide a complete explanation to counter attempts by certain parties to deride the formation of the special task force,” he said.He said the BN and Umno information roadshow would begin in Hulu Selangor before going on to other locations in March.Annuar also said that the Umno information committee was now focusing on three strategies, namely holding talks, information dissemination through the electronic and print media and using the new media.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...90s-forex-loss/"

neoexcaliber,20170220,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,It hasn't even been investigated and he wants to run a roadshow? Doesn't that sound prejudicial to you? Wouldn't that undermine the investigations and the courts?Funny how they use those as reasons to block any inquests into 1mdb but have no problem with this issue.
