saintnotsinner,20170516,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 7,201501,,"PETALING JAYA: Three senior cops suspected to have given protection to illegal gambling dens and massage parlours in Melaka for years have been nabbed.Two of them held the rank of Assistant Superintendent while another is a police inspector. All three are based in Melaka Tengah and Jasin.The anti-graft body is also looking for a former OCPD there, who has since been transferred out. He was said to be going against the norm by choosing not to work with the illegal operators.Several other cops, believed to be involved in the circle offering protection to such illegal activities, are being sought.Also detained in the simultaneous raids were an illegal gambling den operator and a middleman who solicited, collected and distributed the ""protection money"" among corrupt police officers in the state.Sources said all five, aged between 31 and 41, were rounded up during a sting operation at about 11am Friday around Melaka.Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) deputy chief commissioner (operations) Datuk Azam Baki confirmed the arrests.Azam said the anti-graft body was still investigating the case and did not rule out that more arrests were on the cards.All five suspects will be held at the MACC headquarters in Putrajaya and remanded in court Wednesday.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...LQj6hplIjPcm.99"

zstan,20170517,10k Club,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 11,982",200711,,kalau bodoh tak faham undang-undang boleh simpan sikit.MACC can only tangkap and prosecute people. end of the day still need to bring the case to court and mention. suspect still can opt for trial and further appeal. the most they can do is request to set very high bail and throw these ppl into lock up if they can't afford to post bail.

It seems you have insider information regarding this matter.Perhaps it can be used to testify in the court later.Its will be our pleasure to see the corrupted MACC officers go to jail.
