TigerLion,20170710,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201702,,"PR won Kedah and Perak in GE12, but lose them both by GE13. Many of my Kedah and Perak friends working here in SG tell me that it is highly possible!   Which makes me ponder if it is possible for the PH to win 4 states...But there are some factors to consider:(+) Kedah and Perak people have lower trust in BN over the 1MDB Scandal.(+) Kedah and Perak urban population have increased, and urban population tend to vote opposition.(+) Dr M pulling in Malay votes.(+) Increased confidence in PH after seeing Penang's and Selangor's development.(-) No more PAS support. 3 way fight possible. BN benefit on average.(-) PH internal bickering.(-) Bad history of PR's governance.Do you think the opposition got a chance to win back Perak and Kedah this coming election?"

metaled,20170710,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 139,200909,From: Ladang Nasi Lemak,"A couple of mate of my who is deep in the corporate world ( lawyer/auditor ) claim that it was just some financial thing gone haywire and the news pusing into something else. It is no surprise for government investment thing to go wrong but there is plenty of cash inside EPF anyway, plenty.Depends on who u ask but the most interesting answer i heard is BIJAN is doing a fantastic job in countering all those attacks led by an old man, and is doing a fine job steering the ship financially or economically wise, we are a small country and he make a great decision of being friends with everyone who offers money and help. This answer is from a lawyer who mainly deals with acquisition/merging for corporates or GLC/MNC companies.Some unker age auditor friend claim it was x10 worst during mamaktir times, it will make what we see now as child's play. Basically one old man ruin it for everyone in this country, and the guys after him have to work OT to patch up the hemorrhaging wound that is still hemorrhaging to a few lucky individual.My answer is simple, if you are not in the elite family of the country, u came out from the wrong vag. Since it is the wrong vag already, the way not to be suck into being poor is work your hardest to not being poor. The rest matter later.Those people who become elite, they work very hard, in a different way but yes they do work really hard way pass 9-5 to get where they are today, although sometimes they make u feel like things just fall from the sky for them. My boss is one example."
