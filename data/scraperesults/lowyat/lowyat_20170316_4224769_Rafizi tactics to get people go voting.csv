The data is last updated on Jan.Your data should have been in SPR already.Better go SPR office to check. Don't want you also fall to this without you knowinghttp://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...-registrations/
Quang1819,20170316,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 755,201212,,"Yeah saw that too. Will visit SPR. Hopefully it won't be a mess.Edit: I think it says that the last updated was in Jan 2017 with latest list of 3rd quarter of 2016. Since I registered later than September 2016, it might mean that later than September 2016 hasn't been updated yet. *Maklumat semakan adalah seperti Daftar Pemilih Terkini Suku 3 Tahun 2016 yang diwartakanpada 20 Januari 2017."

red streak,20170317,Doto 2 Pinoy Slayer,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 968,200602,,"I got one of these funky automated calls before but it wasn't from Rafizi, it was from some government department conducting a ""survey"" and wanting to know whether it was ""Reasonable to blame the BN Government for the rising living costs""; which was the first question. It was right before BR1M was supposed to be released so of course, I knew lah what that was for...and immediately ended the call"
