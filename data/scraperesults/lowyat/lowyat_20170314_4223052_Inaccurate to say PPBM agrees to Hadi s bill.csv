Some may have perceived that as me agreeing (to the proposed amendments),” he told a press conference here today.“Right now, I don’t even know if they will be tabled in the Dewan Rakyat by Hadi, or by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Jamil Khir (Baharom),” he said, referring to PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang.Muhyiddin insisted it was impossible for him to take a stand on the matter when he was unsure of what would be on the bill after it was tabled and debated in the Dewan Rakyat.“We will wait for it to be tabled. The bill will be debated first, and there may be suggestions for amendments. Until then, it will not be right for me to make a stand.“How can I agree to the amendments when they are still unclear? That’s why I have to see the final version of the proposed amendments first.”Hadi’s private member’s bill is scheduled to be tabled in the current Dewan Rakyat sitting.It was read out twice in the Dewan last year, but both times Hadi postponed tabling the bill, saying he wanted to first make sure the public understood that the amendments would not be applicable to non-Muslims.Umno appears to support the bill as the party’s minister in charge of religious affairs, Jamil Khir, is expected to adopt it as the government’s bill to allow it to be debated in the Dewan.Hadi’s bill aims to increase the penalties for shariah offences, including raising the maximum jail term from five to 30 years, the maximum fine from RM5,000 to RM100,000, and maximum strokes of the cane from six to 100."
