neoexcaliber,20170630,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,One of the reason they cleaned it up when they did was because of that Facebook post attacking Kelantan and the behaviour of its people that went viral.  I think it's ridiculous to turn to this into a political issue when it's Kelantanese cleaning up other selfish Kelantanese' mess.

technod,20170630,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200703,,No hard feeling but your logic is like we can litter in the stadium because we already pay the tickets. Same like we can throw rubbish anywhere and expecting some cleaners to collect them.
