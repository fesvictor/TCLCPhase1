Parrot,20170204,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 418,200704,From: Somewhere. Isolated from the rest of you pukes.,"Good thing Tony Pua doesn't represent my constituency because he runs his mouth like an idiot. But the way the govt. press whales on him is scummy. You should know better that they love to attack opposition members anyway they can to demonize them. I vote on local affairs, and this shitstorm doesn't entirely affect my choice of local candidates.Plus it's effectively distracted from the fact that the 20 sen increase is still a pain in the ass however way you spin it. How much can you blame the opposition when the prices of goods increase again?"
