expendables,20170421,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201310,,"Abdul Rahman Mohd Noor says he knows Najib didn’t sit his degree exams, because he was the attache in the London High Commission in charge of student affairs at the time and had also been detailed to assist with the medical aspects surrounding the last month of Najib’s father’s life.Abdul Rahman says Najib was still at the University when he was handling all these matters at the end of 1975 and departed for Malaysia after his father’s death in January 1976, clearly to mourn his father, but also to immediately campaign to secure the seat left vacant by his death, which he bagged at the tender age of 23.If this turns out to be the case, it is quite possible that the University has nevertheless awarded their most generous alumnus an honorary degree or doctorate. However, without a shadow of a doubt, it is time that the nature of this relationship between politician and university was made fully transparent, given all the money that has been flooding from Malaysia and the investment in Nottingham’s campus in KL.http://www.sarawakreport.org/2017/04/najib...-degree-record/"
