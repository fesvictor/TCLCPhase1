Shariah court punishment is currently capped at jail terms not exceeding three years, a maximum of RM5,000 for fines and whipping of not more than six strokes of the cane.Waythamoorthy said it was “amazing” that Zahid did not give “two hoots” about what coalition partners thought about the matter.He said the non-Muslim community, comprising more than 45% of Malaysia’s population, as well as many sceptical Muslims cannot perceive such authoritarian state control.“It is a foregone conclusion that the coalition partners are mere rubber stamps of the Umno hegemony to maintain power as seen with the impotence and ineptness of MIC’s stance,” he said."
