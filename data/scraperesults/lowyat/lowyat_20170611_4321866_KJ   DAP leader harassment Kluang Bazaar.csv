Two other reports were lodged by others in the party.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...Q4h0WeVMKPpr.99"

nightshade_nova,20170611,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 367,200706,From: 3rd from Sol,Nope. Pretty sure it's more complicated than that. The term in psychology is cognitive simplicity.Some ppl are more prone to think in black and white.Their heuristics are probably > other race = non-muslimAnd non-muslim > aggression.You can be highly educated and still be racist.

rigmortis,20170611,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 59,201106,From: Wherever you are heading,"Point taken.I am just generalising for the lulz. I stand by my statement since it is quite evident, statistically speaking, notwithstanding other factors. Ppl tend to be racist when they do not appreciate and acknowledge ppl of other races since they are so paranoid with self inflicted persecution complex.Racism amongst the Chinese in areas where they are in majority can be quite evident too (but only Chinese would know), but less outward. Probably because they understand they cannot make much demand from a position of weakness. They present themselves as fair and equal when in the public, but I wish the other races can hear the words that comes out of their mouth when they spread their hate amongst themselves.Educated racist tend to be more collected and less direct (i.e. the typical ktard closet racist culture). They are ever-calculating, resorts to mind games, slander, collusion and would sell out their principle if it bring means to the end of their foes.Education when done right breaks down these barriers by promoting integration and appreciation. Unfortunately majority of my most racist friends have something in common; they studied in SRJKC."

They gave questionnaire and select those who considered racist-free. They ran a second test in which they put some kinda brainwave detector. They are shown slides of faces. When suddenly a face emerge other than their race, their brainwave gave spikes. Its normal when the faces are from their race. lololol"
