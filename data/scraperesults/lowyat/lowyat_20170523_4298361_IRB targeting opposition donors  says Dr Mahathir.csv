He was responding to Umno Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin’s earlier criticism that Dr Mahathir was fat shaming a woman.“If he or she is gemuk (fat), then he or she would terasa (feel slighted). That’s not my problem,” Dr Mahathir was quoted as saying.Dr Mahathir at an event on May 16 said he is slim because he does not “makan rasuah” (accept bribes).It is widely understood he was referring to Prime Minister Najib Razak’s wife, Rosmah Mansor.Dr Mahathir has on many occasions accused Najib of wrongdoing in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd scandal, particularly the RM2.6 billion channelled into the prime minister’s bank accounts. – May 23, 2017."

Ali rustam famously wind up a state companies because he didn't want to pay his part of the deal. so now state government (being the owner) has to go to court for breach of contract.but I'm not surprised lah. you support any anti government people even if they are themselves a criminal. just like you defend secret resepi boss for being a dick by increasing the price for profit and not due to cost increase."

I think you confused top glove with supermax, the supermax guy who was the one openly supporting pakatan last general election, and he was promptly slapped with insider trading charges from the 1990s... so now he just keep quiet lest they charge him with another frivolous accusation...3. well now govt. has agreed to sell 49.9% of proton to geely, so hooray?"

I said you support anyone who is anti government basically anyone who  are in a fight with the government and so on. when the government are in a fight with tax evader you to support the tax evader and if they go after profiteers you defend the profiteers and if they go after ex crony well you know.well anti ruling party and anti stupid is your primary cognitive then. pretty much explain the cognitive dissonance that you are doing. that's why you have to assume the government is stupid. so rather than compiling evidence to create a hypothesis. you leads the investigation so it will conclude they way you want it. and that's is the government is stupid. I mean even after the has successfully introduce an unpopular tax increase, reduce the subsidies, make the middle class live miserable and still seemingly will get away with it. you will still think they are stupid.I guess that's why the rules of the art of wars is never undermine your enemy."
