As discussed in Part VI.CC below, a portion of the $620 million thatMALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1 “returned” to the Tanore Account was passed throughvarious additional accounts controlled by TAN and LOW and was ultimately used topurchase a 22-carat pink diamond pendant and necklace for the wife of MALAYSIANOFFICIAL 1. The necklace was commissioned in July 2013, after the jeweler met withLOW, HUSSEINY, and the wife of MALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1 in Monaco. Thepurchase price of $27,300,000 was paid on or about September 10, 2013, using fundstraceable to the $620 million payment from MALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1 to TanoreLel... someone gonna get slapped inb4 DOJ bust the myth by malaysian AG...Liar Liar Pants on Faiya 347. The Attorney General of Malaysia publicly stated that he conducted aninquiry into the $681 million in payments. In a press release issued on January 26, 2016,the Malaysian Attorney General confirmed that, “the sum of USD681 million (RM2.08billion) [was] transferred into the personal account of [MALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1] between 22.03.2013 and 10.04.2013,” and that, “in August 2013, a sum of USD620million (RM2.03 billion) was returned by [MALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1]. . . .” TheMalaysian Attorney General ultimately characterized the payment of $681 million as a“personal donation to [MALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1] from the Saudi royal family whichwas given to him without any consideration.”348. In fact, as explained above, official bank records for the Tanore Accountconfirm that (a) the payment of $681 million came from the Tanore Account; (b) TANwas the recorded beneficial owner of the Tanore Account, © TAN (or someone usinghis email address) directed the payment; and (d) Falcon Bank was told that the paymentrepresented an investment in SRC International. As described above, the only funds inthe Tanore Account at the time of the $681 million payment originated from 1MDB."
