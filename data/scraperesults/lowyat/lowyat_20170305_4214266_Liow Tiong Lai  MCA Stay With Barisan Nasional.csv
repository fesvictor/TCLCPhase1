We do not simply withdraw,"" he said at the MCA 68th anniversary celebration at Wisma MCA here Sunday morning.MCA was set up on Feb 27, 1949.Liow said Barisan was a political alliance and that its constitution clearly stated that it subscribes to power sharing and decision by consensus.""This means every single party is indispensable.""We are equal; therefore we should not be the scapegoat for others' mistakes, neither should we punish ourselves for that.""The calls to withdraw from Barisan therefore are immoral and illegal, and strategically incorrect,"" he stressed.The party president also noted that MCA had in the last 60 years of nationhood upheld moderate values, maintained the joint-governing model set by the three-party Alliance (Umno, MCA and MIC) and later Barisan Nasional which defended power sharing among the various races.""MCA has a 60-year long history of sacrifice in the process of preserving the joint government concept,"" he said.While the MCA has to face much misunderstanding in its struggle, Liow pledged to the Chinese community that the party was resolute in its fight for Chinese political rights till the end.""We will defend all we have as enshrined in the Federal Constitution, at all costs,"" he said, adding that the theme for this anniversary ""Stronger Together"" is food for thought for the party and Chinese community in the face of increasing challenges ahead.""MCA must be united. Unity is strength and strength is power in politics. We can never survive on pity from others,"" he said to loud applause from the floor.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...AwkrvJmtujKX.99"

nivota,20170305,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 130,201006,,"Actually I'm curious as they are having very low support rate for their party now and in the past 2 GEs, do they still have youths that go join their party or mca youth? I know there are still people who joined UMNO Youth because they believe in what they fight for, but whatabout MCA Youth?"
