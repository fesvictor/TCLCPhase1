Just hope to vote in a stronger opposition into parliament.  Like mentioned, cash is KING. Religion is just a tool to influence voters.

joe_mamak,20170417,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,I have seen you say this many times.  Same thing over and over again.  Mahathir's sins have not been forgiven.  Neither has it been forgotten.  LKS is working with Mahathir because he sees a bigger immediate issue that is before him.  LKS could have refused to work with Mahathir.  But it isn't Mahathir that LKS is against now.  It is the present BN government and its policies.  PSNot that I support this cooperation but I can see the rationale behind it.  I can also see the rationale against this cooperation.

But that is what a mature leader should do. You put aside your personal issue and let your party win first."

N resume the fight individually after common enemy is downWhich is a failed strategy. If he really wants to win it, he'll advise dap to go along with pas. No need to support. No need to reject eitherIf dap can swallow what mahathir ever did they accused of in the pas, its a no brainer to swallow whatever pas bring because its their best chance winning the election with pas together. Politic 101 - getting the most votes win. Not hoping on the newcomer bersatu n amanah. Whole nation know pas grassroot is the most active n dont even need money to do work.

PKR and DAP most likely will manage to hold on on their traditional urban areas while Amanah and Pribumi will deliver whatever crumbs leftover seats if any.At most, it will be a status quo much like 2014 PRU but with a twist, you will see a more pro Bumiputra and pro Malay Muslim agendas as BN-UMNOputras thanked its powerbase grassroots with more dedak ..."

Else why dap leadership n mp's been saying no need to afraid in hudud in their past campaign? That helped a lot to ease the tension to non muslim on hudud that time It was not part of election manifesto, but that time both party agree to disagree with whatever items they are agenda to work together. This is what makes pas and also tgna allows pas to be working together with dap, as long as it was not against each other. Dap acknowledge hudud was one of pas agenda. But only when tabled suddenly so many dap mp's triggered"
joe_mamak,20170418,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"You say it was never dropped by PAS.  But it was also not raised by PAS as part of the election manifesto.  It wasn't just DAP that tried to allay the fears and concerns of the non-Muslims but also PAS.  Both parties and various levels of leadership together with PKR leadership emphasized on the common manifesto.  You make it out as if DAP agreed that PAS can move forward with the implementation of Hudud or that meeting to ""agree to disagree"" was a green light for PAS to do so.  It wasn't.  http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2011...on-hudud-issue/...""Hudud is not the common agenda of Pakatan Rakyat for the forthcoming general election,"" DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said, adding it would not be a common policy even after the next general election....Stressing that hudud was not part of Pakatan Rakyat's policy, Lim said it was neither included in the Common Policy Framework nor in Buku Jungga.Lim said the Pakatan government would only implement policies agreed upon by the three component parties."

maraippo,20170418,~PoPoPoPoPo~,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,059",200807,From: Kami's Palace,"Hudud is not a common policy, nor it was listed under buku jingga. Those are the stuff that all 3 component party agreed on to work togetherPR is unique. Its unlike BN. All 3 component party have very different ideologyThat is why, from my understanding prior GE13, each component party agree to disagree with whatever agenda their counterparts fighting for. This is the main reason that allows PAS to work again with DAP. By that, means PAS can continue fight for what they've been fighting for all these years. The other component party no need to support or bring it as their agenda. PR is a platform to fight together on common issues. No need to support oso can. But DAP sabah/sarawak (i cant remember) pancut awal cut ties with PAS at the mention of hudud, which lead to further breakup of PR.  The climax is when DAP announced PR disbanded without consulting with all 3 component party. Pancut awal oso. Which is funny when PR still considered valid in Selangor"
joe_mamak,20170418,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Your understanding is different from DAP's understanding.  Also, if PAS was so damn intent on having Hudud, why didn't it make it clear from the start?  Why not talk about implementing Hudud in their campaign speeches?  Sure, go blame DAP Sarawak for cutting ties with PAS.  We also can say PAS emphasizing on Hudud and not much of anything else that lead to the break up of PR."

Langkah kajang was done without the approval of all 3 component party of PR. Its was a solo action by pkr. Only after it was announced, the matter is brought forward to the others. PAS basically doing the same thing. They proceed with the same reasoning. ""They can do it why can't we?""This is why I always say langkah kajang is the start of the break up. Anyhow, back to topic, which is much more interesting than talking stuff that is already in the past. Can PH win without PAS?"
