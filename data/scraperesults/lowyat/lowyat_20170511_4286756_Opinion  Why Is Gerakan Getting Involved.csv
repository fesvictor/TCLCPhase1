ironmaid89,20170511,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"U8hv7GoLP_cThe way I see it, yesterday's Gerakan-organised event, where JJPTR refunded OKU investors, is to regain public trust in what could be termed a ponzi-like scheme.I just read a report about JJPTR refunding the investments made by 100 investors comprising people with disabilities (OKU) at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.According to the report, the event was facilitated by Gerakan, a component of the Barisan Nasional and the government.The first thing that came to my mind is why is JJPTR only refunding the investments from 100 OKUs? Why no refunds to other investors, including the poor, single mothers or the elderly?And why is Gerakan, a part of the BN, involved in publicising the refunds? Is it trying to create a good image for JJPTR?It’s obvious that the publicity intended from such a refund is to regain public trust in what could be termed a ponzi-like scheme. Some may even call it a ponzi scheme.In the end, the public will continue to support the scheme and the public will suffer greater loss. Is this what Gerakan and the BN want?I have personally seen how “ponzi” schemes have damaged the lives of families and the elderly who have invested their life savings in them.Innocent people are made to suffer because of the greed of a few. Even the government is going all out to weed out these “ponzi” schemes.So, why is Gerakan getting involved in trying to give an image lift to JJPTR?I hope Prime Minister Najib Razak will do something about these “ponzi” schemes and make sure no BN component supports it.WS Teoh is an FMT reader.With a firm belief in freedom of expression and without prejudice, FMT tries its best to share reliable content from third parties.
