ironmaid89,20170207,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"Last time he quit PKR after almost a year joined because cant fight Azmin for PKR deputy presidencyDatuk Zaid Ibrahim has decided to quit PKR, saying he has had enough of recent turn of events in the party.""I knew my days in the party were numbered because the leaders were relentlessly making personal attacks against me.""I am quitting because I want to dissociate myself from liars and cheats. I do not want to be part of a group that propagates lies and does not have any qualms about cheating for as long as the end justifies the means,'' he told The Star.Zaid, who joined the party in June 2009 after a fallout with Umno, said he would take a short break to ""get away from all the attention"".""I am not sick of the party, I am sick of the sick leaders in the party,'' he said.The former Cabinet member pulled out of the race for the PKR deputy presidency last week, citing the leadership's failure to address allegations of manipulation and fraud in the party election system.He dropped a bombshell when he asked party adviser Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to quit, saying PKR would not be able to implement its reform agenda as long as Anwar and his ""preferred"" deputy presidency candidate Azmin Ali remained in power.Zaid said he had been attacked for merely asking for a clean, free and fair party election.He said that right from the start of polling when he was leading the pack in the race for the No. 2 post, he had been calling on party leaders to seriously look into irregularities in the balloting process.http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNew...115-247315.html"
