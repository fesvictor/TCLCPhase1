They just blind because their sight have been covered by the veil of religion render them blind to the crux of the matter.They think that as long as they implement hudud, All is well in Malaysia.  They think of hudud as the elixir of every ills in Malaysia. Implement hudud and the invisible hand will punish those who do bad deeds. That's what they think. What escapes their mind is that who runs justice in Malaysia. As long as we have the same pipu in the court house, no matter how many laws we have, we will never have much justice. And since most of them are malay... sigh... they never think of corruption as haram as pigs if not, even of higher degree if haram than just consuming pigs. Can't help it...  eh?"
