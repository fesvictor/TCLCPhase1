joe_mamak,20170501,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,Why would DAP supporters vote for PAS after their party has been declared the enemy?  BN also considers DAP to be the enemy.  Maybe DAP supporters should just not vote at all in places where it is PAS vs BN.

PH needs to have a common manifesto and logo like BN, only then they can pull a real fight.  The PH may be have diffrent formula but they need to have BN  like strategy . First, tell the voters who will be the PM.  To say PM will be decided after ph secures putrajaya wont sit well with most voters"

teongpeng,20170502,Justified and Ancient,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 1,918",200710,,haih u guys r right.DaP shouldnt have meddled when PAS were fighting for hudud. At that time PAS were bringing that issue up against BN. All DAP had to do was to keep quiet. There was no way BN will agree to hudud anyway with many stalwarts like Nazri and several others openly label it as stupid.
