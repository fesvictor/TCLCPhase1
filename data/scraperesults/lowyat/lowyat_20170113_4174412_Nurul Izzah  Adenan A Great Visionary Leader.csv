It is a shocking loss.We pray that his (Adenan) family has the strength to go through this difficult time with patience and fortitude.“We also pray for more leaders to understand the importance of placing nation before self and also for us at this moment of grief to come together to understand that it is such value that unites us,” Nurul Izzah said when met after paying her last respects to Adenan at his residence yesterday.(From left) Baru, Tian Chua, Dr Teo, PKR Mambong branch chairman Willie Mongin and See at the State Mosque for the funeral service.Among PKR leaders present to pay their last respects to Adenan were its deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali, vice-president and state PKR chairman Baru Bian, deputy chairman Abang Zulkifli Abang Engkeh, vice-chairmen See Chee How and Ali Biju, treasurer Dr Michael Teo and state PKR women chief Nurhanim Hanna Mokhsen.Nurul Izzah hoped that Adenan’s passing would be a strong reminder of what more needed to be done for Sarawak and Malaysia. “Hopefully more leaders can aspire that.”When asked whether it was an achievement for Adenan after having been recognised by Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission (MACC) as a leader of integrity, Nurul said: “Oh…definitely”.“I think it is quite clear that  regardless of our political differences, we hold him in high regard and his vision, of course, had helped guide many from across the political spectrum to understand, empathise and appreciate how important Sarawak is to Malaysia and how important Malaysia is to consider all of its partners with equal strength and respect.”Meanwhile, Azmin, who is also Selangor Menteri Besar, said he was there to convey condolences to Adenan’s family on behalf of PKR and Selangor state government.Azmin acknowledged that Adenan was a great figure and leader who was much loved by Sarawakians.“He (Adenan) had tried to make changes in the state government administration since becoming chief minister. We appreciate his efforts and we pray that his soul will rest in peace.”http://www.theborneopost.com/2017/01/13/nu...sionary-leader/"
