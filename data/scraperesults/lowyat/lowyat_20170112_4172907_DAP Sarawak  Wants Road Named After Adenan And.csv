This is an attitude that should be followed by all leaders in Sarawak, especially the person who will replace him, Ling told The Borneo Post yesterday.Ling said although he was aware that Adenan was not in good health, he was shocked by the news of his death.“He was a Chief Minister who had served in the shortest time, but I, as well as DAP Sarawak, hope his approaches on forest and environment rehabilitation, funding for private secondary schools as well as the process to claim back Sarawak’s autonomy from Putrajaya would continue  and be expedited by whoever takes his place,” he added.“I personally feel that Adenan had wanted to bring many changes in policy, but with the strength of one person in the old and difficult BN system, it was not easy.“Sadly, time is not on Adenan’s side as a chief minister to bring about all these changes  but at least since he took over in 2014, the people of Sarawak had hopes to see Sarawak’s position in the federation of Malaysia improve,” he said.Ling took the opportunity to convey his condolences to Adenan’s family and pray thet they have the strength to face this trying time together with the people of Sarawak .A statement from PAS Sarawak yesterday said Sarawak had lost a chief minister who fought for the rights of natives and for Sarawak’s autonomy.PAS Sarawak commissioner Jofrie Jaraiee who is also PAS Miri chief said many Sarawakians would find it hard to accept the loss of their chief ministerbut they must stay strong and be united in this difficult time.“Many still could not accept the fact, because the people of Sarawak, especially those in the rural area, are still very much in need of his service as a chief minister.“Even though he only served as chief minister for a short period of time, his contribution will be remembered forever,” he said.Jofri said PAS Sarawak hoped the person who takes over his place will continue to fight for the best of the people just like Adenan did.http://www.theborneopost.com/2017/01/12/da...d-after-adenan/"

Besides, the Borneo branch of opposition parties seem a lot less hot-headed compared to their Peninsular counterparts. They're a lot less hostile to Adenan compared to those here vs Najib."
khusyairi,20170112,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,201112,,"Late Adenan Satem already told that he is the leader of all races, leader of government & also opposition of Sarawak. All BN politician & opposition is his friends; they can talk anytime to him. He willing to help DAP politician whether in good time or bad time including help pay for medical expenses. That's why less oppo when law read up in DUN.That's the different from peninsular or sabah leader."
