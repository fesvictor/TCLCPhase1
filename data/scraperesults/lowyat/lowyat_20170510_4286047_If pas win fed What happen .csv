PAS always thought Malaysia is Saudi ... with a lot of oil so people don't have to work and just need to practice religion and let the oil money take care of all the expenses. Between BN and PAS, I will go for BN, reason being ... BN is full of greedy politicians, to fill their greed, they somehow too will fill the economy so that they can continue to fill their greed, country will die but prolong death. PAS well ... there is only one master plan and that not include in putting food in our mouth.Due to poor education quality, so I think yes there is chance people will give PAS a chance ... if you think Trump is bad, try PAS."
