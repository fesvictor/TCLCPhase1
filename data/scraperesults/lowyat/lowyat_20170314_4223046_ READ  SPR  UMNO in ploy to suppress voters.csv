Implications from this confirms a few things:1) UMNO is 100% behind this as the address is used as Pembantah's address and saksi2) PDRM is seemingly involved and protecting the gang? (not confirmed)3) Yes, mass bantahans are occuring without valid reasons.4) SPR officers wanted to silence the media and took photographs of whoever demands their RM100 compensation5) UMNO people are sitting at the SPR counter and having same voter list with SPRhttps://www.facebook.com/BERSIH2.0OFFICIAL/...368003313238415hNaYvUHa1NU"

I'd suggest you read up more first. For starters, them ignoring any pleas of help and photographing anybody who demands the RM100 compensation. The SPR is supposed to protect the voters not sit there and do nothing. Did you know that the judge even knows that the bantahans were invalid? Read the youth's account and observation.The law states pembantah must pay the voters directly, not through any 3rd party or UMNO. That is the crux of the issue. SPR officers even admitted that but did nothing. is this not proof of SPR protecting them??and DAP was never mentioned in the articles. not even once.as for PDRM, if you read the youth's account, it implies that they knew exactly what was going on and the UMNO people was hiding behind them.I'm sure doing these mass bantahan and denying constitutional right to vote is not a conspiracy and we are just being paranoid."

Incidentally, pembantahs were all UMNO members. personal experience: I registered the same address with my parents and siblings. Why did I kena bantah when SPR should have my address in their database?So this issue is not so simple anymore. All fingers points towards a ploy to deny voters constitutional rights. and read this illogical statement and tell me what do you think of the validity of the pembantahs. Which begs the question, did UMNO did this delibrately and without valid reason? How can you say you know their address but bantah them anyways?http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...-registrations/"

If you have read the articles (which I'm sure you have not), then you'll realize that the objectors knew the address were valid but they bantah anyways. Is this clean in your eyes?

Just like You can bantah any name in the electoral list.You come from SG ke, UK ke, US ke, it is up to you....Your choice to be there and meet SPR....No one force you too. Worst case, your kids name wont be in the list. If being in the list and voting is worth more to you than the cost of travelling. Go to SPR office.Go blame UMNO for their practice. Better yet, sue them to recover your kids cost....Stop playing victim card. It is getting absurd. Especially after the 400k bangla voting episode....."

SPR is accepting these invalid bantahans and you are telling us not to blame them?Victim card? do you really not care that people are wasting their precious time and money over something that isn't valid in the first place?? being in the voting list is our constitutional right! no one forcing us to go? you do know that without these invalid bantahan people can happily move on with their life? If SPR would even check whether the addresses exist then none of this would have happened. Damn right we are blaming SPR. so that's what all this is about. you are letting your hatred over the 400k bangla thing and clouding your vision from what's in front of you.

What you should do if you're unhappy is to make sure UMNO or whatever party those objectors belong to actually pay the fine.
