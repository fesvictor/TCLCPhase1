It is a major political force in SG, with it's coalition group winning 1 seat in 2001 and 2006.This is impressive considering that the most popular opposition party in SG, Worker's Party, also only won 1 seat in those 2 elections.The most important thing is PKMS' adaptability. Instead of campaigning on a Malay supremacy platform, PKMS is practical enough to adopt a more moderate platform and decrease it's racial undertone. So don't underestimate UMNO. It is an excellent organization, run by smart and capable people, which political influence spread across the Malay Peninsular."

TigerLion,20170415,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201702,,The only difference between them is that SG Malays are envious of the benefits UMNO brings to Malaysian Malays.
