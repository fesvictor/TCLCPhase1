If previously we had an agreement, now we are free to contest wherever and as much as we desire,” he was quoted as saying by BH.PAS’s declaration for Permatang Pauh is the party’s most overt act of hostility so far against PKR, with whom it severed ties during the Islamist party’s muktamar at the end of April.Permatang Pauh is considered the home base of PKR de facto leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, and is being held by his wife, Dr Wan Azizah, while he is serving his five-year sentence for sodomy.Either Anwar or his wife has held the seat since 1982.PAS had been part of the defunct Pakatan Rakyat with DAP and PKR, before the pact was declared “dead” by DAP following its arguments with PAS over the latter’s push to empower Islamic laws.http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...-others-as-well"
