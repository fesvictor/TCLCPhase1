Di Kedah, jumpalah dengan Lee Guan Aik.Bekas ADUN DAP Teratai di Selangor, Jenice Lee tentu ada banyak rahsia untuk dikongsi dengan penentang anak beranak Lim.Dr. Hiew King Cheu di Sabah pula bagaimana? Kesemua mereka kini berada di luar DAP - sama ada letak jawatan atau dipecat.Bulan lalu, Melaka juga digemparkan de­ngan tindakan empat orang kuat DAP keluar parti.Kalau ditanya kepada mereka di lima negeri berkenaan, jawapan atau punca kenapa keluar DAP ada persamaannya - berkisar tidak puas hati dengan amalan kronisme, tidak demokratik dan diktator kepimpinan DAP Pusat.DAP berada dalam genggaman erat anak beranak Lim. Ini sehinggakan anak perempuan dan menantu Kit Siang pun ‘meraih’ jawatan.Dalam penggal pi­lihan raya 2008 dan 2004, Betty Chew (isteri Guan Eng) adalah ADUN Kota Laksamana, Melaka. Adik perem­puan Guan Eng, Lim Hui Ying pula setiausaha DAP Pulau Pinang.Selepas menang banyak kerusi di Pulau Pinang dalam Pilihan Raya Umum Ke-12 (PRU-12), DAP dikatakan memanggil satu mesyuarat. Satu soalan ditanya, siapa yang sewajarnya jadi Ketua Menteri?Dikatakan ada yang mendakwa dirinya paling layak sehinggakan pemimpin DAP lain yang hadir dalam mesyuarat agak tersentak. Bukankah jawatan itu sepatutnya diberi kepada anak tempatan, pengerusi DAP negeri, Chow Kon Yeow?Tarikh perbicaraan kes rasuah pembelian sebuah banglo melibatkan Guan Eng dan ahli perniagaan Phang Li Koon dijadualkan bermula 27 Mac ini.Mungkinkah DAP semakin ber­kecamuk dalam tempoh itu?Artikel Penuh: http://www.utusan.com.my/berita/politik/da...8#ixzz4bZq3VYSB © Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd"

Mencari salah orang, diri sendiri lebih banyak salah.Dua insiden yang dicetuskan oleh DAP, pertama dalam sidang Dewan Undangan Negeri (DUN) Melaka kelmarin dan ke­dua di sidang DUN Johor semalam begitu memualkan.Memualkan kerana kalau kena batang hidung sendiri boleh pula buat selamba sahaja. Namun jika bab cari kesalahan orang lain, sanggup bermatian-matian dan bikin gamat untuk membuktikannya.Di Melaka, ADUN Ayer Keroh dari DAP, Khoo Poay Tiong sanggup meninggalkan sidang DUN kerana kononnya tidak puas hati dengan jawapan Ketua Menteri, Datuk Seri Idris Haron dalam isu melibatkan pegawai kanan negeri itu yang dikaitkan de­ngan rasuah. Kecoh dibuatnya sehingga dua lagi wakil DAP ikut jejak Poay Tiong keluar dewan.Di Johor, hal sama berlaku apabila wakil DAP, Yeo Tung Siong dari Pekan Nanas cetuskan kekecohan mempersoalkan Menteri Besar, Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin yang memberi penjelasan berkaitan satu skandal rasuah.Sanggup juga Tung Siong meninggalkan dewan.Wah! kalau begini prinsipnya, baguslah. Tetapi mengapa DAP - menerusi tindak tanduk Poay Tiong dan Tung Siong - mengamalkan prinsip `berpilih-pilih’.Bukankah dalam sidang DUN di Pulau Pinang sebelum ini, ba­nyak usul BN ditolak, antaranya isu tambakan laut. Kononnya kata ketua menterinya dari DAP, Lim Guan Eng, usul ada motif politik.Demikian juga gesaan wakil rakyat BN di negeri itu agar Guan Eng bercuti atau digantung tugas sementara kes rasuah pembelian banglo miliknya selesai, pun tidak dilayan.Desakan itu bukan sahaja disuarakan oleh wakil BN tetapi daripada ADUN DAP sendiri pun.Kebimbangan Teh Yee Cheu (DAP-Tanjung Bungah) yang mempersoalkan kerajaan negeri terus mengekalkan Guan Eng pun dipandang sebelah mata.Di Selangor pun sama juga. Usul tergempar yang dibawa oleh BN pun ditolak. Ini berhubung isu pengambilalihan ekuiti Syarikat Pengeluar Air Selangor Sdn. Bhd. (SPLASH),berjumlah RM2.975 bilion iaitu 10 kali ganda lebih tinggi daripada tawaran asal sebanyak RM250.6 juta.Sedangkan Speaker DUN dari DAP Hannah Yeoh sepatutnya membenarkan usul bagi menggesa pendengaran awam segera dilakukan Jawatankuasa Pilihan Khas Mengenai Keupayaan, Kebertanggungjawaban dan Ketelusan Selangor (Selcat) di DUN. Bagi menjawab kekeliruan berhubung penstrukturan industri air di Selangor.Adakah gelagat yang dicetuskan oleh DAP dalam sidang DUN Melaka dan Johor umpama maksud peribahasa Melayu ini?“Sungguh kawat yang dibentuk, ikan ditebat yang diadang - tipu muslihat yang tersembunyi demi mencari keuntungan sendiri.”Artikel Penuh: http://www.utusan.com.my/berita/politik/bi...0#ixzz4bZqJzuah © Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd"

Afterwards you can destroy DAP forever as you always have the factual statistics to back up your guesswork, sounds like a pretty good deal.It's like you heard about this shitty movie but you never watched it yourself (not even torrent it) and you keep telling people around you how shitty it is but when asked, you've never watched it in the first place, it'll never become a convincing argument to anyone, even yourself.If (it's a big if) you hate change so much just say it out loud, say you're happy with your current government and you don't want it to change.
