hackwire,20170711,Look at all my stars!!,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 4,180",200501,,"memang sakit hati. the one who executed the order simply abuse their power but not punished. This shows that those who executed the arrest does not knows anything about the law . Suka suka tahan for nothing.

radical85,20170711,lalala~~,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 623,200510,,Malaysian are really really really dumb. Inefficient dumb government do stupid stuff get sued over. Now so many white knight butthurt say she shouldn't sue government so as not to waste taxpayer money. Lol. Do u idiots know u waste so much more tax payer money by throwing garbage on the road (basically everywhere except garbage bin). Let me tell u stupid fucks why-garbage will pile up and cause flash flood. $$$ lost from asset dmg n clean up-government need to hire more bangla to sweep floor-plus highway need to do more periodic clean up. Expenses increase for them in the end translate to toll rate hike My point is there is so much money wasted due to complacency and outright neglect of civil awareness. U guys want the government to belanja berhemah? U start doing that by doing the right thing urself. Stop pointing fingers at the government
