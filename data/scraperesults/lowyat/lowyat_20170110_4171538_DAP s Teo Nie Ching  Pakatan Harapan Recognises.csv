We welcome all forces to join our fight against Umno and (Prime Minister) Najib Razak.“But for Muhyiddin to say that Pakatan may not recognise UEC … I don’t think he is in a position to say that.”The UEC is a standardised examination conducted by the United Chinese School Committees’ Association of Malaysia (Dong Zhong) in 60 Chinese independent secondary schools in the country.Muhyiddin, who’s also Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) president, said earlier today that in order to recognise the UEC, it must first include the History subject, because its current syllabus and exams do not reflect national values.Responding to that remark, MCA Youth secretary-general Leong Kim Soon said Muhyiddin cannot challenge the loyalty and patriotism of UEC students.“UEC students study Bahasa Malaysia, sing the Negaraku during the school assembly and also sit for the SPM exam.“Now that Muhyiddin has openly declared and warned that PH may not recognise the UEC, it is time for DAP to come clean and admit the opposition rejects the UEC.”http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...ects-muhyiddin/ Muhyiddin: Pakatan Harapan May Not Recognise, Unified Examination Certificate (UEC)https://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?showtopic=4171254&hl=UEC"

MsGaijin,20170111,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200812,,"Wait BUKU JINGGA is for PAKATAN RAKYAT right? Now since PR is dead already, any mutual official statement from the current PH stating that they will rely on Buku Jingga?Because apparently PEMUDA PAN@AMANAH stated that a new manifesto for PH must include the youths' views as well. So technically it can be assumed that Buku Jingga is no longer the official manifesto of PH. DAP memang biasa buat unilateral statement aye?https://www.facebook.com/amanahnegara/posts/1303854259659276"

joe_mamak,20170111,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"I don't know what is your beef.  She was qualifying that “recognising UEC has always been our common agenda” with references to Buku Jingga and the People's Manifesto.  So, the old coalition has broken up.  Does it mean the manifesto or whatever you call it, the very one they used in their election campaign, tak boleh pakai anymore?We should hold them, each of the parties, to it.  They broke up, that's their problem.  You might argue Amanah is new but their current members in Parliament also shared the same common agenda when they ran under PAS."
joe_mamak,20170111,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,Takde gaduh.  Just responding to what Muhyiddin allegedly said.
joe_mamak,20170111,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"No lah.  Just setting the record straight.  Muhyiddin also not qualified to speak for PH.  Heck, his party isn't even in PH."
neoexcaliber,20170111,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,But both PH an PPBM have agreed to form a new coalition. Surely he's able to speak on behalf of that coalition to a certain degree.I actually agree on Muhyiddin's and BN's stance this time.
joe_mamak,20170111,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,Is it?  Seems they only have an electoral pact.  No coalition yet.
neoexcaliber,20170111,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,They haven't formed it yet but they did sign an agreement last month to form one so it's only a matter of time.
joe_mamak,20170111,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,I might have missed it but all I remember is that there was only an electoral pact.   Nothing more.  There was talk of Bersatu joining PH but it only remained as talk.
MsGaijin,20170111,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200812,,"What Beef, I'm just pointing out what Tion Ni Ching is just mirroring what she alleged Moo-hyidin is doing which is self-representing PH~ when neither of them is speaking on behalf of Pakatan Harapan. Unless a new manifesto has been officially issued, to simply slate that Buku Jingga is Pakatan Harapan's manifesto is inaccurate or else Pemuda PAN wouldn't be suggesting the involvement of PAN's youth in the future manifesto. So Tiong's latest statement that Pakatan WILL acknowledge UEC is an official policy of which Pakatan? PAKATAN RAKYAT or PAKATAN HARAPAN?"
joe_mamak,20170111,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Tu future manifesto.  Now no manifesto ah?  Damn, I want to hold them to whatever manifesto that they used to get themselves elected.   Actually, we should and we must.  PSTeoh is not mirroring lah.  IMO."

MsGaijin,20170111,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200812,,"Well, it's your opinion afterall. And I'm still with mine:1: Tiong Ni Ching cakap tak serupa bikin, sama macam Moo-hyidin;2. Buku Jingga is Pakatan Rakyat's Manifesto;3. PR is already pronounced dead;4. PH is not PR;5. Buku Jingga is not PH's manifesto.Well that's what I thought la~ oh if so much so that Buku Jingga should be continued by PH, when will PH state-gomen-funded Institute of Higher Learning such as UNISEL be giving free education to their students as to be aligned with the policies of Buku Jingga? It's already 2017."

joe_mamak,20170111,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"Now I am wondering what is all this silly argument about.  I don't see her referring to the Common Framework Policy or Buku Jingga as PH's policy.  The Facebook post, was a reference to Pakatan.  The photo posted was Pakatan Rakyat (it is mentioned there)'s common framework policy.  Waste time only lah."

Aren't you needling him with the premise that PH would continue to adhere to the policy/manifesto?  So, why not the same with Teo for this case?"

I'm already feeling a little bit disappointed.And by the way, even without referring to the PR's Buku Jingga in my criticism against Nik Nazmi, the scrutiny against Nik Nazmi is still a legit one as he is the Exco Pendidikan and he's the one who promoted Free Education as can be seen in this news article a few days ago~http://www.sinarharian.com.my/kolumnis/nik...-ptptn-1.607379"
