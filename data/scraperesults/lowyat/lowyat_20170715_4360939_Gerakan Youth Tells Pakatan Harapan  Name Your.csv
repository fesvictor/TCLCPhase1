We want to protect the voters so they know who they are voting for,"" he said.Tan added it could be timely for the Election Commission to make it lawful for any coalition contesting in the general election to name their designated prime minister.He also highlighted the fact that Pakatan's youth wing was sidelined and holding no position in the leadership line up was an ""embarrassment"".He also noted that since Pakatan wanted to give more autonomy to Sabah and Sarawak, its leaders failed to demonstrate a single bumiputra representative from the two states.""The closest they can get is Sarawak DAP chief Chong Chieng Jen,"" he saidhttp://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...UcbUqpX8wXO9.99"
