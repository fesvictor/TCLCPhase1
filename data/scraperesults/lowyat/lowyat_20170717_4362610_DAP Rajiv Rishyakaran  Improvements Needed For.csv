But it would be better to acknowledge our need for improvement and have an action plan, rather than assuming we are the best in the world,” he said.At the launch of Phase Two of the Sungai Buloh-Kajang (MRT SBK) line today, Najib said he had been told that Malaysia’s MRT system was better than those in London, New York and Hong Kong, and on a par with that of Singapore.In a report by The Star, the prime minister added that Malaysia’s MRT system was “world-class”.However, Rajiv said the MRT system had poor connectivity as only those within walking distance of the stations or driving distance from stations with park-and-ride facilities could easily use it.“Many others can’t because the feeder buses are not adequate.”He said Malaysia only has 1,500 buses compared with London, which has 7,500 and Hong Kong, which has 10,000, adding that many of the buses did not run due to the lack of drivers.“Public transportation must connect everywhere to everywhere. If not, many can’t use it, even though you may live or work next to a MRT station.”Rajiv said the Selangor government had identified 12 railway lines to be built.He said the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) and the federal government must acknowledge and plan for these lines to provide holistic coverage in the Klang Valley.He also criticised the MRT fares which he said were too expensive.“It’s time to bring back the monthly pass that we once had.“Fares for public transport users now can cost more than RM200-RM300 a month, which makes public transport not attractive.”He added that end-to-end fares for the MRT cost RM6.40, while similar fares on Singapore’s MRT cost S$2.28 (RM7.15).http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...orld-class-mrt/"
