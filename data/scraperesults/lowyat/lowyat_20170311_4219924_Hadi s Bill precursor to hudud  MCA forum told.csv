Basri disagreed that Hadi’s Bill would lead to hudud, however, saying it does not expressly seek to do so in its current state.The Bill in its latest form seeks to raise the Shariah courts’ maximum sentencing limits to 30 years’ jail, RM100,000 fine and 100 strokes of the cane. The current limits are hree years’ jail, RM5,000 fine and six strokes.“It is just a proposal… We don’t know what’s going to happen in the future.“You cannot worry about something that has not happened. It is like worrying North Korea is going to launch a nuclear missile at us,” he said.Hadi’s motion proposing the Bill was seen in the Dewan Rakyat Order Paper on Tuesday, its fifth such appearance in Parliament’s agenda.The PAS president’s proposal has gained added credence since Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said his administration will eventually adopt the Bill.sos"
