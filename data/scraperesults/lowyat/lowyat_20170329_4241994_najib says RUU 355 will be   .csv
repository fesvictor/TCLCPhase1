Old news -http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...men-kata-zahid/BN akan bentang RUU 355 di Parlimen, kata ZahidFMT Reporters | March 18, 2017Zahid berkata, perkembangan itu memperlihatkan kerjasama kerajaan BN dengan 'rakan baru' yang pernah menjadi musuh politik suatu ketika dahulu.zahid-ruu355PETALING JAYA: Kerajaan Barisan Nasional (BN) akan membentangkan sendiri rang undang-undang meminda Akta Mahkamah Syariah (Bidang Kuasa Jenayah) 1965 atau RUU 355 di sidang Parlimen kali ini, kata timbalan perdana menteri.Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi yang dipetik Utusan Malaysia berkata, tindakan itu selaras hasrat Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Najib Razak yang begitu komited mengetengahkan hasrat berkenaan tanpa mengganggu-gugat kepentingan kaum dan agama lain di negara ini.Timbalan pengerusi BN itu berkata, perkembangan itu memperlihatkan kerjasama kerajaan BN dengan “rakan baru” yang pernah menjadi musuh politik untuk bersama memelihara kesucian agama Islam dan kedaulatan bangsa.“RUU 355 akan dibentang sendiri oleh kerajaan di Parlimen tidak lama lagi. Insya Allah dengan doa untuk kita menyatukan orang Melayu. Biarlah kita kehilangan segelintir ‘kawan’ kita, tapi kita akan dapat ‘kawan baru’ yang kumpulannya lebih besar bersama kita.“‘Kawan baharu’ kita ini mungkin dulu musuh politik kita, tapi mereka sudah faham untuk sama-sama tangani masalah (berkaitan Islam) dengan tidak mengetepikan agama lain,” katanya dipetik akhbar itu hari ini.Ahad lalu, Najib dilaporkan berkata, kerajaan pimpinan BN mengutamakan langkah mendahulukan rakyat dalam sebarang kerjasamanya dengan PAS demi memastikan kesejahteraan rakyat.Katanya, pemimpin parti berkenaan perlulah mengetepikan ideologi sempit politik kepartian dalam jalinan kerjasama sedemikian kerana ia tidak memberi keuntungan kepada mana-mana pihak.RUU 355 pertama kali dibentangkan Presiden PAS, Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang di Dewan Rakyat pada Mei 2016 bagi memperkasakan Mahkamah Syariah.Ahli Parlimen Marang itu pada sesi terakhir Parlimen November lalu meminda usul itu dengan menaikkan hukuman penjara kepada 30 tahun, denda tidak melebihi RM100,000 dan maksimun 100 sebatan berbanding maksimum 3 tahun penjara, denda RM5,000 dan 6 kali sebatan yang boleh dijatuhkan Mahkamah Syariah ketika ini."
