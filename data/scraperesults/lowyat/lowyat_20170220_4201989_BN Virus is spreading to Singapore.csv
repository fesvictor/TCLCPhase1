We need to update our water prices to reflect the latest costs of water supply,”He noted that the price increase will go towards maintaining Singapore’s water infrastructure, and more expensive sources of water such as desalination.Including taxes, the prices will go up by 30 per cent in two phases. The first hike will be from 1 July this year, and the second from 1 July next year. type=""video/mp4"">Within the hour of posting, hundreds of comments were made on the videoTay Chin Peng wrote, ""How about reducing the MP's salaries. It will help remind them the importance of working hard to earn money for a living.""Albert Tiong wrote, ""OK. Now I'm aware of it. Can you reduce the price back to what it used to be?""Daddie Yowzer wrote, ""You want to know who are the people who really waste water ! Those that stay in houses .. Especially GCB ! I've worked for them .. I know .. Everyday water plants, garden the size of HDB flat and their cars .. So just because they pay its ok .. Compare to a person staying in HDB ... How much can we really use or waste ! Female version of KBW! Oh and those who say 69% voted .. True maybe .. but didn't vote for these two clowns.""Lau Kok Kheong wrote, ""The awareness for the hawkers and restaurants to increase their food and drinks prices too~ do they aware? Or they just don't care.""Curtis Lee wrote, ""What make you think that we are not aware? My water usage is way below National Average. You are punishing people like me who are concious about water preservation.""Sharingan Ismadi wrote, ""We have a water agreement with Malaysia that hasn't expired. We also have a desalination plant and most likely another on the way that should be paid for? I haven't read the article but 30% increase is kinda extreme. Its like saying our nation coffers are so dangerously low that cannot afford to build the project first and then we pay for it slowly in the long term.""Albert Tan wrote, ""We have been paying ""Water Conservancy Charge"" for decades, that's supposed to create awareness for saving water, isn't it fair that the tax subject to Service Charge and GST too?
