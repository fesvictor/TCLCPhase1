The Malaysian Home Ministry, however, denied the claim.Zakir is under investigation in India for spreading communal hatred and glorifying terrorism.Zakir, 51, was also reported to be sought by India’s Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case.The republic’s National Investigation Agency was also investigating 78 bank accounts and investments amounting to Rs100 crore (RM65 million) linked to him, NDTV had reported.Zakir, had caused a stir last year after he was alleged to have insulted Hindu deities and practices.He is also reported to have been banned from the United Kingdom and Canada, following his apparent support of terror group, al-Qaedahttp://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...us-in-malaysia/"
