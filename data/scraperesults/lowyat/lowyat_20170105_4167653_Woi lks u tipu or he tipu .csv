Now you can see him screaming rba rba whenever it comes to dap n chinese. Sigh, and to think I once stood in the rain in ss2 to listen to his speech back in 2008"

DuO LoN,20170105,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 404,200601,From: Kuala Lumpur,"he admitted he has knowledge of the ruler who has been briefed and is aware of the matter. he did not say he has been reliably informed of who the Ruler is.can you see his play with words? Now he claims he never said what he said but it was someone else telling him all those things. if it is merely hearsay, why would he say he has knowledge of who the Ruler is? he should just say he has been reliably informed and not that he has knowledge who the Ruler is and is aware of the matter.You see the bullshit spin RPK likes to do? hahaahahha. internet is a wonderful thing. you can't hide your past so easily."

darthboyzzee,20170105,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 42,201502,,Percaya what? Percaya that someone he trusted told him that kak mah was there?
DuO LoN,20170106,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 404,200601,From: Kuala Lumpur,"You need to learn to read. He did not say he was reliably informed the ruler knows who the person is. He says the ruler indeed knows who the person is.  If rpk himself isn't sure who the person is, how then can he be sure that whoever the ruler knows is indeed the correct person. Oh well, probably too difficult for you to digest anyway.Btw, the word ABU originated from him. So enough of fhe ""oh rpk was betrayed"" crap please. Even before altantuya story he was already chanting ABU. Now that he is switching sides, he is conveniently blaming Anwar for everything .And have you ever wondered why is it that despite him claiming that whatever he was told was false, he had never revealed who the informer was? If my informer has been lying to me from day one and I found out about it, the first thing I would have done is to tell the whole world who the informer is. After all the person betrayed me. But rpk has not done so until today. Why? Obviously because it is all a cock and bull story. After all what has he got to lose? He already claimed that he is no longer afraid of anything anyway."
