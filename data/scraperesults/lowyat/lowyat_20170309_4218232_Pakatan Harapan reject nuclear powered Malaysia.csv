Well, it's nuclear. Cost aside, mishandled it, and you will wish it is just a polution...As a whole, to handle energy requirements, need better approach than just keep increasing the output. Need to look into how to reduce the energy demand as well.In USA, even menial stuff as simple as replacing incandescent bulb with energy efficient LED/CFL bulb has been met with surprising resistance."
