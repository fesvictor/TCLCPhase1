wanted111who,20170312,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 474,201204,,"Doing protest when ppl are helding a ceremony, especially a happy one is definitely wrong. Uncle in a white shirt doing a brilliant job. Good choice to do it somewhere else. It shows it all.In the other hand, why that blue uncle shouting? Cannot tell nicely? + it's very quiet there, doesn't know ppl are wedding in there. If I passed by, I wouldn't know ppl are wedding in there. The blue uncle keep on shouting like he's looking for a fight , of course ppl will respond negatively. Still the outcome is the protestor going to somewhere else. That's call challenge?  Idk.Edited, if we were to shout when the blue held protest, definitely it will end up with a fight."
neoexcaliber,20170312,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,"Not everyone sees the big picture.I lived in Taman Desa for more than 20 years so I have a rough idea where that hall is. It's probably one of the closest venues to the Malay-majority part of Taman Desa and since it's going to be replaced, I wonder where the next nearest one to them would be. Like someone else pointed out, venues like this are more affordable and are usually booked on weekends for various events so expecting protests to happen on a weekday is unrealistic. Both sides should just give and take instead. That being said, one side didn't respect the boundary since both sides have their rights.Plus, it doesn't look like the scuffle damped the celebration much. I can still see photos of happy attendees on FB and the article mentioned that the protesters left after the commotion so it should be obvious that a compromise was made."
