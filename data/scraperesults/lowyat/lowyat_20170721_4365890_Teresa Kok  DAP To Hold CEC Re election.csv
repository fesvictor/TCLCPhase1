Everything is subject to their approval, otherwise we cannot move forward,"" he said.In 2013, the RoS had ordered a re-election of DAP’s CEC after it found irregularities and manipulation of votes by the party in its initial election in December 2012.After the re-election, some party members claimed that they were denied the right to attend the party congress as delegates.In a statement earlier this month, RoS director-general Datuk Mohammad Razin Abdullah instructed DAP to hold a re-election of the party’s CEC, saying that it is necessary as the election of CEC members and key positions via a re-election on Sept 29, 2013 was deemed unlawful.https://www.nst.com.my/news/politics/2017/0...n-under-protest"
