But he got no issues pon with letting umno decide on who to be prime minister during his tenure. Got consult other coalition members?Not only that, seems like he personally hand picked badawi and bijan as his successor. Hypocrite betul la si mamak ni..."

What about other government decisions like public transport, other projects.  If all need to have consensus, we will end up like philippines where they can't even fucking erect integrated lrt station because their senate is bickering with the executive why so expensive, why u build there not here,.. Why here and there.. It's fricking delayed for 10 years iinmSo many spoons spoil the broth"

scorptim,20170309,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 378,200911,,"UMNO decide for BN because UMNO has more than 50% of the seats in BN. Even if it goes to voting, in the end it will be UMNOS choice that gets the post. Now with the opposition, DAP had the majority seats in past GE but we don't know about this GE, if DAP has more than 50% seats in the opposition govt then they get to choose, otherwise it will be via voting. Everyone knows his wrongdoing and recently he admitted his own wrongdoings. So let's bersangka baik and move on. Heck, pro BN ppl can bersangka baik even when najib deny all his wrongdoings but when people bersangka baik towards pakatan suddenly it's wrong? Do bear in mind all the shit in this country is BN fault, coz they're the only govt this country ever had. Well, it is an important post so better to take time to decide, unless you think what we have been doing in the past was better which is simply letting the UMNO people decide whoever the want to be PM. Heck, that's exactly how we ended up with najib. In terms of consensus on projects,  Let's not jump into conclusions before the actual thing happens yea. Right now you're just assuming and being afraid of change."
