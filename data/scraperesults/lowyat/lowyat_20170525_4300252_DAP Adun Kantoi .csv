The sitting is adjourned to 2.30pm,” Asfia said as he made the ruling in the DUN Chamber.Prior to the vote, a heated debate between the ruling and opponent benches took place during Wong’s winding up speech.Wong asked Dr Ting to confirm whether he had acquired Australian citizenship, to which the DAP man said he was not obligated to prove that since Wong was the one who raised the allegation.“I’m not the one who alleged it. So you need to prove it to me. Would you ask member for Batu Kawa (Datuk Dr Sim Kui Hian) whether he has Australian citizenship?” quipped Dr Ting.Asfia then rose to Wong’s defence by pointing out that “this is not a motion against Bawang Assan (Wong) but it’s against you.”Wong was asked to proceed with his winding up and he advised Dr Ting: “Do not try to mislead this House anymore. Do not try to confuse anyone.”An opposition member or two could have challenged Wong to repeat the issue outside the dewan as the minister was heard saying: “I will do it. Don’t challenge me. I will do it.”Wong cautioned that such a challenge would only “land Dr Ting in hot water” as he insisted that he had concrete evidence that Dr Ting had accepted Australian citizenship on Jan 20, 2010.With Dr Ting’s disqualification, the Pujut seat is now vacant now and a by-election should be called within 60 days."

beverlykho,20170525,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 29,200712,,"Wong stands by claims against sacked Pujut repPETRA JAYA: State International Trade and E-Commerce Minister Datuk Seri Wong Soon Koh stood by his claims against Pujut assemblyman Dr Ting Tiong Choon, in that the latter is a bankrupt and holds dual citizenship.He backed his claims by producing two documents to support his allegations.One of the two documents is a letter by Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department (CID) responding to Wong’s enquiry over Dr Ting’s alleged Australian citizenship.The letter dated May 4, 2017 was signed by Bukit Aman CID director Datuk Seri Mohmad Salleh.The letter stated that, police, based on confirmation in writing by the Australian Federal Police, found that Dr Ting had acquired Australian citizenship on Jan 20, 2010.The letter also stated Dr Ting had renounced his Australian citizenship on Apr 4, last year, about a month before the 11th state election.The second document produced by Wong was a report of Bankruptcy Register Search (BRS) from the Australian Financial Security Authority.BRS contains personal insolvency information about individuals, which is derived from the National Personal Insolvency Index in Australia.Based on the report extracted on July 2 last year, about two months after the May 5 state polls, Wong said Dr Ting was declared a bankrupt twice in 2012.“I did the search on Dr Ting’s financial status last year. From 2012 until 2016, he had never settled his debts as his name was in the list,” Wong told reporters, here today.Wong, moved a ministerial motion to disqualify Dr Ting during the state assembly sitting last Friday.Dr Ting, a general medical practitioner by profession, was disqualified after 70 assemblymen voted in favour of the motion. Only 10 assemblymen voted against."

Nevertheless, the Federal Constitution must be upheld as the leading legal reference and respected by all.""This is not a question of politicising an issue, but a question of principle upheld by the legislative system and the people of Malaysia,"" he said.The Sarawak assembly disqualified Dr Ting as the assemblyman for Pujut on May 12 citing his alleged Australian citizenship. DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng, however, claims that the assembly had abused its authority to disqualify Dr Ting, and that the matter will be brought to court. -- BERNAMA"

neoexcaliber,20170525,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,200501,,"But you said he had intention to break the law so it should disqualify him as a politician. Your example of using Bangladeshi and Rohingya doesn't make sense when they don't have citizenship in the first place. This guy is still a Malaysian and he didn't temporarily take up another citizenship like that DAP guy in Sarawak. Also, if you think it's wrong for a person to claim another country as their home, maybe you should campaign to remove the Malaysia as a second home programme.    Having multiple homes does not equate to disloyalty to the country.I didn't say that. I said the Constitution asks for loyalty to the Federation.

He doesn't have the same privilege RPK has.What you're asking is for his citizenship as a Malaysian to be revoked and to leave him stateless. Does that even make sense to you just because you don't agree with his politics? The only reason the government would get involved would be on the question of citizenship and not his position as a politician. He's still a Malaysian and he hasn't given that up. Intention aside, he's doing a lot more for the country than most of us in /k. Is it really hard for you to accept that a person's goals and intentions can change? Giving up citizenship is not betraying the country or disrespecting the King.And he's not representing you. He's not representing me either. It's up to the people he's representing to decide that but you're asking for a higher authority to do that on your behalf.Intention to swap loyalty is not swapping loyalty. He hasn't changed his citizenship but you're arguing as if he had. You're equating intention with carrying it out."
