Divou,20170116,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 2,201505,,"PETALING JAYA: Parties from all political divide should allow the Barisan National candidate to win uncontested at the upcoming Tanjung Datu by-election following the death of Tan Sri Adenan Satem, says Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS). “If Sarawakians from all political divide really mourn the passing of Datuk Patinggi Adenan Satem, let them ‘walk the talk’ by letting the Barisan candidate for Tanjung Datu in the forthcoming by-election, win uncontested,” its Youth secretary Bit Surang said in a statement on Sunday. He said this would be the “true hallmark of respect for the late Adenan Satem”. The late Chief Minister passed away due to a heart attack on Wednesday at the age of 72. He was replaced by Datuk Amar Abang Johari Tun Openg who was sworn in as Sarawak’s sixth Chief Minister on Friday."
