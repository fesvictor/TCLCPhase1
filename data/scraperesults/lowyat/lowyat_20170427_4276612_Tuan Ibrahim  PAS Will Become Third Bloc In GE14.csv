This is why we want to move towards mature politics.""This in line with the president's wish. We must find ways to improve this country and Pas is definitely an alternative for the people,"" he said when officiating the Pas Youth wing's assembly at Kompleks Pas Kedah, here today.Tuan Ibrahim in his speech also set the tone for GE14, calling the youths to step up their game in countering provocations through social media.In doing so, he said the youths must stand united to ensure that any provocation created by the enemies will not affect Pas in any way.""The Deputy Prime Minister (Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi) has announced in Kelantan that they want to make the state 'blue' again by toppling the Pas state government.""We must remember our struggle back then...what it was like for (former spiritual leader the late Datuk) Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat...remember all the sweat and tears we had to endure before we finally managed to capture Kelantan.""""But, God willing, we will keep Kelantan and at the same time we will again capture Kedah and Terengganu aside from continuing ruling Selangor.""http://www.nst.com.my/news/politics/2017/0...third-bloc-ge14"
