When eventually completed and opened, it cost RM1.18 billion in 2003,"" said Lim in a post on his Facebook page.Later, the company went bankrupt and was bailed out and taken over by government-owned Prasarana Malaysia in 2007 for RM882mil.The Putra LRT line was a privatised line that started operations in 1998 and went bankrupt.Lim said the compnay was bailed out and taken over by Prasarana in 2002 for between RM4.5bil to RM5.7bil.The Star LRT line started operations in 1996 and then went bankrupt.It was bailed out and taken over by Prasarana in 2002 for RM3.3bil.The Intrakota bus services that started operations in 1998 also went bankruptIt was then bailed out and taken over by Prasarana in 2003 for RM177mil.Lim compared the four projects to those of current Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, saying that all are government projects that do not have concession agreements.""LRT1 extension, LRT2 extension and now the recently launched MRT Sungai Buloh–Kajang line, which are all in the hands of the government, does not have concession agreements that requires periodic fees increases,"" he said.Lim said that the projects were also all delivered either on time and on budget, or ahead of time and below budget."

I believe much was spent there. also, if you see dramas from 80's, KL was not congested. only in late 80's and early 90's saw much buildup in population and traffic, and also the sudden need to cater to SUKOM."

VoidDance,20170720,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 7,201703,,"I think the biggest catalyst in Malaysian public transportaton is PLUS North South Highway. Prior to that the development of west peninsular was not as rapid as after its completion. On that, TDM did the right thing when everybody else mocking him for creating what they thought as going to be white elephant. Even the LRT/Monorail was planned in the 80s and it took time to complete. Back in the 70s, Petronas were just started to grow and the money from it to support development was not enough. We didn't see rapid development a-la Singapore during the 70s to merit MRTs or proper public transporation in Klang Valley even thought we should've been prepare for it. It was during the early 90s when the economy start to explode, our people gain more access to wealth, cars began to flock the streets and create gridlock everywhere. I remember how difficult it was to entice the people to use LRT services when they started. Even during normal working days also not that many using it. This is like 1/2 a decade before TDM quit as PM. So, really there were no apparent development in public transport during Pak Lah days actually, not during TDM. Most those public transportation service also fail during Pak Lah tenure. So to blame solely on TDM is nothing more a political bullshit."

PappyBoyington,20170720,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 142,201606,,"I believe though the Govt of the day (80s-90s) made a conscious decision to put more priority on private vehicle ownership due to Proton - this is when you see all the highways being built or existing roads expanded. The LRT/Monorail was mostly a response to SUKOM '98 - plus the cronies needed more project so they proposed to EPU directly and got the wahyu to proceed, never mind the ticketing systems, signaling systems and rolling stock were all different, leading to lack of economies of scale and resulting in bankruptcy for all the players. They were all expensively bailed out by the Govt soon after. KTM was sidelined in all of this - imagine if KTM were allowed to build all these using an integrated approach, using professionals like today's MRT Corp, Prasarana, RapidKL etc - we would have had all these back in 2000!PS - SPAD, the regulator and planner for all these was only created in Jun 2010, a year after Najib became PM. Credit where credit is due."
VoidDance,20170720,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 7,201703,,"Part of it, yes. To spur Proton growth. But come on, that alone couldn't possibly be the reason of building highways. Route 1 was so gridlock back then the travel between Ipoh to KL took many hours to reach during the festive season. I remember it vividly when my uncle car needs to take a rest near Bidor after many hours driving from Ipoh. It was timely. Proton aside, the NSE really spur development along its corridor as we can see today. That cannot be because of Proton alone, right? People won't want to live in Seremban and work in KL if not because of NSE. Same with other regions where NSE run along it. The article clearly said that Monorail was planned and approved in 1989. If not mistaken, we only know about KL becoming SUKOM host until much later. Same goes LRT. If not mistaken, LRT project for KL was mooted in 1985, almost the same time when Proton starts to roll on Malaysian streets. I remember back in the 80s how magazine/newspaper portraying LRT running along Klang river. KTM already started with their Komuter in the 90s so in a way they were not sidelined. It just that planner during that time was not planning it properly. Much later TDM started KTM double tracking project in the late 90s/early 2000 only to be scrapped by Pak Lah and it was only restarted by Najib after that. I still stand by my statement that it was during Pak Lah time that our public transportation project hit a huge stumbling block. Najib restarted it back and improve it on many fronts. Credit to him on that. So to blame TDM with failed public transportation project is nothing more a political bullshit. He used cronies, no doubt. Like UEM, Gamuda and whatnot are not cronies too."
