PAS vice-president Datuk Mohd Amar Nik Abdullah has advised party colleague Datuk Mahfuz Omar to resign if he is unhappy.He said it was preferable for the Pokok Sena MP to leave instead of badmouthing the Islamist party, The New Straits Times reported today.“It is Mahfuz who should leave PAS. It is better for him to quit instead of being neither here nor there.“He is a PAS member but attacks and criticises the party. It is better for him to leave the party. Why stay on in PAS?” he was quoted saying.Nik Amar who is also Kelantan deputy mentri besar was responding to recent reports of Mahfuz telling off the PAS leadership for its refusal to co-operate with the other Opposition parties, mainly DAP and Parti Amanah Negara.Mahfuz, among PAS representatives, has also been seen regularly at events held by the other parties that his party is at odds with.Nik Amar also reiterated that PAS was used to working alone and didn't need the help of other parties to win the next general elections despite attempts by the other federal Opposition parties to mend their ties to ensure a straight fight against the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition."
