The seventh one we will decide later,"" said Salleh.He added that regardless of the strategies employed by the Pakatan Harapan coalition, its arrival could not be compared to Barisan as the latter had a tested method of cooperation between the various races and tolerance among its leaders.Pakatan announced its leadership line-up after the presidential council meeting Thursday night, and plans to finalise other details in its constitution before submitting its registration to the Registrar of Societies (RoS) in a week's time.The pact also unveiled its logo at the press conference held in the wee hours of Friday morning.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...svMwUutrWXZP.99"

Seriously he's the most annoying Minister I hope to see him go away. Prior to being appointed Cybertrooper Ministry he's been paying up Raja Putar Kamaruddin to feature his blog to make him more prominent.God I feel like punching this guy.
