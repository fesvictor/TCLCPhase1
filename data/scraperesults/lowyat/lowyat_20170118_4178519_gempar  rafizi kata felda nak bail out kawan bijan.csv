But after so much rafizi datang lagi now I think both 2x5. I can just roll dice to vote because clearly both simply wanted to own putrajaya above anything else.So I say.. bijan vs rafizi is 50:50.Bijan also got legitimately good people under him, rafizi also same. But individually, both suck monkey balls."

So how much damage can rafizi do? give the oppo a chance to govern to teach barang naik a lesson, if they don't do well, then can always vote back the barang naik.This will teach barang naik a lesson to listen more to the rakyat grouses instead of listening to some people who don't rep the majority."
