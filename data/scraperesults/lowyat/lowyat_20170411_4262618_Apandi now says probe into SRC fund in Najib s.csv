Unless and if there is new evidence that warrants a file to be reopened and investigated again, we will do so,"" he said.""No files are closed permanently when we say NFA, even the 1MDB file.”Advised not to speak to the mediaOn the reason why Apandi did not correct the misconception surrounding the case earlier, he said it was because he was advised not to speak to the media then.""After that PC, I was advised not to talk to the press, and that was why I received the worst treatment,"" he explained.At the press conference on Jan 26, 2016, Apandi said no charge would be brought against Najib based on the investigation carried out by MACC on the RM2.6 billion political donation and the RM42 million SRC International funds that went into Najib's account.He had said then: ""Based on the facts and evidence as a whole, I, as the public prosecutor, am satisfied that no criminal offence has been committed by the prime minister in relation to the three investigation papers.""I will return the relevant investigation papers to MACC today, with the instruction to close the three investigation papers.""SRC is a former subsidiary of the prime minister's debt-laden brainchild 1MDB.Najib unaware about SRC moneyThe SRC money was deposited into Najib's account in two transactions - on Dec 26, 2014, and Feb 10, 2015 - after being routed through two companies, Gandingan Mentari Sdn Bhd and Ihsan Perdana Sdn Bhd.Najib has reportedly claimed to be unaware about the money from SRC, and attorney-general Apandi also cleared him of any wrongdoing in the matter.Apandi also told the press conference then that Najib had returned US$620 million from US$681 million (RM2.6 billion) that was channelled into his personal bank account.The Malaysian Insight also quoted Apandi as saying: ""Investigations into the rest are still going on, on 1MDB and SRC International. I had said NFA (previously). It is a standard directive given by the AG or the DPP (deputy public prosecutor) to investigation agencies. What it means is that it is NFA up to that date.""If I decide to open up, then I can open up any time, no file is closed. No further action does not mean that the file is closed.""Malaysiakini is trying to contact both MACC chief commissioner Dzulkifli Ahmad and deputy chief commissioner (operations) Azam Baki for their response on this. The two of them have so far not answered our phone calls or replied to our text messages."
