What do you guys want in life?1) What do you think the definition of success is, for you?2) If you could describe the perfect life, what would it look like. How much money would you have? What kind of job? Where would you live?Alright, go!"

kingz113,"  Yesterday, 12:52 AM",Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 66,Joined: Jul 2006,,"This question has had me thinking for a while now. At this point in my life, I can comfortably say I am at a great place in life without wanting more. I am 30 and have everything I can ask for. A small business as a professional, a beautiful wife, active sporting and social life, a comfortable home (tho still on loan), cars paid off, heavily insured. The wife and I make quite abit of money and including our EPF, we save a good 60-70% of our income (we are not into the lavish lifestyle), accountable spiritually, almost successfully reigning in all my adolescent vices. Man thinking back the last 4 years was hellish to have build what I have today. Btw I was already financially independent since 18 so I'm already quite good with handling money. The one key to contentment is to reign in on your expectations, and not chase after lavish lifestyle that are meaningless and very often, done to please others. Everyday before I go to bed, I count my blessings and wonder what have I done to deserve what I have at such a young age. I'm still preparing for the day when it all goes to shit tho lol.Edit: I only live in a terrace far from the city, and have 2 regular Asian cars but I feel successful af"

Flanegan,"  Yesterday, 01:02 AM",Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 117,Joined: Mar 2009,From: Borneo / Kanto / Seoul,"1. Success is where I can do something I like and make a living with it.2. A perfect life is where A country where well behaved citizen,a good public transport,a good social welfare,an affordable living lifestyle, a citizen who knows what they want and need to live without heavily influent on luxury and fair competition on business. I personally hate money and personal finance. I live a Minimalist life, as long I have a decent extra cash for yearly travel to visit friends and learn their culture, and enough savings for future funeral. All should be fine, at the end of the way what a person left is just a memories and I wish to left a positive side instead of full of negative like what we have now with life. Career wise, something I love, good at and got respect and know the value how much they should pay. Is Malaysia a great place to stay? Maybe only in East Malaysia. Peninsular/Malaya is just a temporary for me. But if you talk about my personal dream, I used to live in Melbourne, Europe and Tokyo. I will choose Tokyo because everything is decent there and I prefer the lifestyle as Independent Career. But not good if you live for a company forever."
