A lot of the time also his 'admission' of guilt are sarcastic replies which people just closed one eye to because so desperate to get an ally against Najib. No, he really fucked up this country in so many ways. He ruined almost all the country's institutions and led us to becoming almost a failed state controlled by gangsters. The future of our descendants are affected because of this man. Unless he is actually punished and serve time, no forgiveness for him. And I'm being lenient. For some things like Project IC, he should be tried for treason."

The friends that knows me, knew my flaws and yet have no problem getting along with me. The people who don't know me, have reservations about me, I don't blame them.This is not about me. God gave me this ministry to point people who have lost their way to God. How?I'll be the first to admit I'm no leader material. I have my flaws, I still can get angry. I still can be stubborn. Yet I have a relationship with God. The Lord did not reject me. God hears my prayers and still answers them until today. God still speaks to me until today, in fact just this morning around 8am. I still see the Grace of God, his divine favours being poured in life and my families life..being manifested, despite of my imperfection.What is my reason for telling you this?"

And I personally think najib had a few good years early on in his reign.And I believe many who say/blame BN support because some BN supporter die die wanna defend the supreme leader. And it goes from high ranking politician to average joeBy all means, gst is good. But execution is bad, imagine if gst was implemented in TDM time, damn probably no one care, but in this economy and with all the scandal surrounding najib, everything he did is blown out of proportion, the truth to the allegation is not to be discuss here as it'll be off topic and to no end.Yup, and that's the catch 22 situation najib facingCutting subsidy, intro gst and etc all are good in the long term survival and growth of Malaysia.And as such he becomes more unpopular, make worst the slowing down of economy makes the magnitude of changes skyrocket.But he can't win election if he remains unpopular and thus we start seeing plotek2 and racial issues being played and paranoid fear being instill to the less educated or less aware layer of the population. Which then further increase the hatred among smarter ppl against najibBecause that time TDM also have porpulist policy to make ppl happy, national car la, low fuel price la and etc etcI'm not saying it's good, but ppl don't tend to think too much when life is comfortable. But now we're paying the price la.But what is past, is past, no point comparing, if want hauled up tdm and go to court, but don't la go use, dulu tdm this tdm that, then instead of investigTing both, all attention is shift to TDM for own political survival These screwed policy leads us to where we are now, so the blame game starts.

There is literally no choice left other than going for Pakatan Harapan.I get that being an Idealist and rejecting gutter politics is attractive, but it is not what we need right now. We need a drastic change and switch to the lesser evil at this exact moment. What else do they propose to do? Keep MO1 in power till the country is destroyed while proudly proclaiming they rejected Dr.M's hypocrisy? Do they feel happy for thinking stuff like ""Wow Najib will use same tactic 30 years later so we reject Mahathir to avoid precedents from happening I'm so ethical and just!!!! I'm so proud!!!!"" The country and people simply don't have the luxury of having squeaky clean politicians to save us now.Be realistic, is what I would say to those who reject Dr.M for his past mistakes. We get that he destroyed Malaysia in the past, but what choice do we have now? I want those idealists to explain how they propose to defeat the present regime in a country with guillable voters baited by race and religion 24/7 other than relying on the hugely popular Dr.M. Dr. M has immense respect among the Malays. That is a fact that the Opposition needs to embrace. We can worry about them after kicking out BN. Then hopefully new politicans will enter the scene and we have better ones to change in the future generations.Idealism doesn't work in politics especially in 3rd world democracies like our country. Idealism will destroy us sooner by trying to choose angels that simply don't exist in this young country. Without any decent shakeups in the political scene (we have not changed federal government in the history of Malaysia), you won't find the idealistic leaders that you want."
