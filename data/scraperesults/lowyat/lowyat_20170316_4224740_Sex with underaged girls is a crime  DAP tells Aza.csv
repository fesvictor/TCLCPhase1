It is called statutory rape,” Teo said.Teo, who is Kulai MP, has been championing a ban on child marriages as part of a new law to combat sexual crimes against children.Yesterday, Azalina said the focus of the law should be on the crimes and not on issues, such as child marriage.“In my opinion, we should look at what the criminal elements are today. This law is more for the criminal element,” the minister in the prime minister’s department had told reporters.In a statement today, Teo said Azalina’s excuse was “pathetic”.She also criticised remarks by the prime minister’s wife, Rosmah Mansor, who in 2015 had said child marriages were rare in Malaysia thanks to a good education system and low poverty rate.Speaking at a Ford Foundation breakfast meeting in New York, Rosmah also said a task force had been set up in 2014 to raise the marriageable age for girls under shariah law from 16 to 18.“But now, two and a half years after her beautiful speech in the US, where are we in raising the marriageable age for girls?” Teo said.Teo, who is also DAP assistant national publicity secretary, said Rosmah and Azalina had both called for unity against child sexual abuse.“But now I want to throw the same request back to them. Can we all be united in banning child marriage in Malaysia?”http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...-tells-azalina/"

RGRaj,20170316,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 40,201304,,"You don't call somebody bodo before the argument is concluded. In any case it's your Sunni scriptural Hadith sources, where Aisha herself gave direct testimony of her age of marriage at 6, and consummation at 9.It is only logical to wait until she has reached puberty, to consummate the marriage. Something that won't be necessary if she got married at 19. And the hadith of she still playing with doll is from hadiths, not Shia speculation.No where in the reliable Hadith or Sira is there any other age given. Thus the burden of proof is on you to show an equally reliable Hadith or Sira to counter the generally accepted age of consummation."
