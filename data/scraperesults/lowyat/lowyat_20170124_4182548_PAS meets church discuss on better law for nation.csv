bumpo,20170124,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 237,201303,,end of the day what matter is the letter of the law (or bill in this case). assurances on what it really means is meaningless  also why review law stuff with religious ppl? shouldnt they do it with law ppl instead?
alanyuppie,20170124,Look at all my stars!!,Group: Senior Member,"Posts: 2,629",200607,From: here,"trust me to say that the term ""discussion"" is subjective especially the group is a religious one (political party or department) . Same like last time JAKIM willing to discuss over hotdog issue.. I duno what happened behind closed meeting room doors.... one party ended up totally kowtow to the one waving their penis ready to pancut if not follow their way."
