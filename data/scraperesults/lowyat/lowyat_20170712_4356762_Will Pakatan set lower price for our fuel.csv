PH cant even resolve his own internal shit. Im sure if PH ever hold Putrajaya, more and more drama will pop up between all the parties in PH. Agree to disagree is bullshit and never gonna worked for long term."

Because that's a stupid thing to do.Just imagine -- all those rich bastards with gas guzzling too blardy big SUVs get subsidized too. What for they get subsidized?
