But for Mahathir to suggest the CIA declassified 13 million pages of documents just so that they can leak two pages related to BMF aimed at demonising him is ludicrous,” he concluded.In the report released by the CIA last week, the agency said Mahathir’s administration was likely as it affected his leadership in Umno and Barisan Nasional then.The former prime minister yesterday alleged that theme of the report was retaliation by the US over his overt criticism of the country’s policies.He also questioned why the document was only released now when the BMF scandal, which cost the country billions, took place in the 1980s.http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia...h.JXn3EcoH.dpuf"
