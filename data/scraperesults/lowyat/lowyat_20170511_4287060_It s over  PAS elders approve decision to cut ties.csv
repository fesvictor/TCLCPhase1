With the break up of the coalition, shouldn't they go back to the people to determine if the people still want them? it seems they don't know why they were voted in the first place.. or they just buat dunno.. since got a taste of power already.. its hard to let go.."

silent_stalker,20170512,Enthusiast,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 820,201204,,"Thats y I think azmin should bubar the DUN. If PAS just hold a small number of seats, sure no need, but thats not the case. Let the selangor people decide who they really want. Coz right now 1 part say PAS won bcoz of DAP supporters, 1 other part say PKR won thanx to PAS supporters n so on. So now we can actually know who selangor people want.But im sure azmin no balls to bubar. His seat was won just a bit higher than BN candidate last ge. His position is the most fragile 1 right now."

LamboSama,20170512,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,201108,,because they represent that party/coalition.was there a Pakatan symbol or PAS symbol for PAS candidates?
