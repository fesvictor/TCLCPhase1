silic0sis,20170503,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,200508,,Looks cheap to me. For harapan logo maybe better to do a hand reaching out to another hand.

silic0sis,20170503,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 31,200508,,"Now that I think about it, prolly bad idea.Most of the typical imagery people associate with hope/harapan doesn't work well in Malaysia lol.Holding hands, might get huge backlash from muslims.Dove, too christian.Putting hands together/cradling something, too christian.So you end up with a thumbs up lol."

Yellow very striking in daylight and easy-spotted during night time or afar. Its simpler so the word HARAPAN is floating above the rest. Clean and minimalist.The only downside, the word HARAPAN should be black #0000."
