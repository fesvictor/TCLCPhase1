It’s a terrible lie.“Just because you don’t give money to Chinese schools on time, it doesn’t mean others are like you,” he said in reference to the issue of the delayed disbursement of RM50 million in federal government allocations to Chinese schools nationwide.Recently, DAP and MCA have been involved in a war of words over the delayed disbursement of the RM50 million allocation.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...e-school-funds/"
