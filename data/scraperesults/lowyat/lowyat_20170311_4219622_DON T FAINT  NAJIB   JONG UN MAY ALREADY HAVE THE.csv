expendables,20170311,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 19,201310,,"A SHOCKING UN report on North Korea's arsenal has revealed Kim Jong-un could have a deadly hydrogen bomb at his disposal.Details about the ruthless dictator's deposits were highlighted by UN investigators tracking his weapons-of-mass-destruction programmes.They found the North attempting to sell materials for creating nuclear weapons to the highest bidder.Among the materials was a form of lithium metal, which is a key component for creating super-powered nuclear weapons.Nuclear experts believe Lithium-6 is a sign of Kim's ambition to attach miniature nuclear warheads to ballistic missiles, which he has fired four of in this year already.They also see it as a sign of the hermit state's ambitions to create advanced weapons.Former Pentagon official Henry Sokolski said: ""Lithium-6 is ideal, not only for making tritium for boosting fission devices, but also for directly fuelling advanced weapons – including thermonuclear bombs.""When enriched by 40%, lithium-6 can be used to produced tritium, used to create fission bombs and hydrogen bombs.High levels of the element on its own can be used for fuelling H-Bombs.Read more at http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-new...r-United-States"

Kopitiam",Group: Elite,"Posts: 1,659",200702,From: KL,"North koreas leverage has always been ""if you dont do it, then ill use the nuke!"". Its all based on others thinking north korea might. The only reason people arent curbstomping nk is china - its presumed that china has nk on its leash.If he actually uses a nuke, itll lose its leverage and everyone who is in danger will invade. After all, if china is supposed to control nk and fails to stop it from using nukes, then whats the point of having china there? Rather than wait for more nukes to fly out of nk, you might as well take the risk of going against the pla.In fact, itll make the most sense for china itself to invade. If nk becomes uncontrollable and might cause invasions, might as well you invade and keep the nk area as a buffer. From nk's point of view, if it wants to start a war, it wont waste its few nukes on a faraway country - might as well nuke south korea and make their soldiers cross an irradiated seoul, or nuke the us pacific fleets (if their system can find them).It doesnt even have to get that far - the moment kim jong un tries to do something too crazy, its just plausible some of the generals would just quietly shoot him. The propaganda may seem that everyone is behind jong un, but the generals arent stupid and dont want to die. Just say jong un died of a 'heart attack' and have his sister as glorious leader."
