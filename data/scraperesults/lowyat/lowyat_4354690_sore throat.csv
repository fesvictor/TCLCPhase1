Stepsil and Dequadin are two sample of antiseptic that you can buy off-shelves. Hack and Fisherman Friend is not medicated but just contain eucalyptus oil (minyak angin)
Mikethebodo,"  Jul 11 2017, 10:17 AM",New Member,Group: New Member,Posts: 0,Joined: Jun 2017,,do not take strepsil after u brush ur teeth at night. Because overnight the gula in the strepsil will accumulate and attract germs to attack your enamel. I learn this lesson and lost one tooth due to that. Strepsil very bad for the teeth.

Drink it. Wait few minits, eat the raw garlic. But i prefer to just drink lemon+water and take 2 tablespoon of honey directly. Wait a few minits n eat the garlic"
