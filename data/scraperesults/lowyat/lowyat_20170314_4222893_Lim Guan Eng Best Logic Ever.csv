lopo90,20170314,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 472,201011,,Sometimes dap likes to exaggerate stuff. Back when I volunteer for impian sabah. They publish that they were helping a remote village to build a mini dam for fresh water supply because they don't have any. Which is good for a charitable cause. However...... We the volunteers know that kinda exaggerated the situation because the village did have a source of fresh water supply before hand. The propose mini dam that was build was sort of like an added bonus to make water access more convenient
