cjlio1,20170109,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 170,200912,,"sure can still migrate if you have sound health and no prior convictions. but of course if you pass 40s most of the time you need to do step 3 as belowbasically got a few type of migration visas1. try and migrate via your specialty but you choose placement yourself2. try and migrate via your specialty but govt will place you3. invest in Australia, buy stocks, open business, buy property etc ..Bottom line you need to know why you want to go there and it is not easy uprooting and move everything over.Is it because of the lifestyle change ? OZ is the quintessential work hard and party hard style. Quality is always better then quantity and come Fridays its payday and the first round is on me.For families it has good medical and education facilities. transportation is almost everywhere and the key is on avg always on time.Food is abundant and racism is practically not present in certain areas unless you are an Indian, Paki, Bangla or people from that region. Best states for Asians to be are as follows in order1. Victoria, this is the best state with a smorgasbord of high end and low end living2. WA, this is the best place if you like a laid back lifestyle3. NSW, highest end of living where money is no object lifestyle4. SA, this is what i termed as the outback city of OZ5. NT, i suggest to not come here as this is just .....  NT"
