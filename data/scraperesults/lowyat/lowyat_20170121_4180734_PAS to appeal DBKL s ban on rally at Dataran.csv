We will ensure the rally is conducted in an orderly manner,” Tuan Ibrahim said, adding that they will enlist the help of 2,000 volunteers.The Bill seeks to increase the degree of penalties in the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1965.It is expected to be retabled when Parliament reconvenes in March."
