As at yesterday, Isa’s wife, Bibi Sharliza Mohd Sulaiman, owes Felda Travel more than RM200,000, which is an outstanding two-year-old debt. Felda Travel has about RM22 million in debts out of which more than RM6 million are over 120 days. And most of these outstanding debts involve Isa’s family.--------ask Isa what did he do to the Grand Plaza Serviced Apartments owned by felda."

JimbeamofNRT,20170610,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 181,201209,,"ok let's google keyword: Muhammad Zahid Mohamed Arip a.k.a. Zahid Mat Arip.he was Isa Samad’s 2004 campaign manager, who was then the federal territories minister.Zahid’s campaign strategy was so successful that Isa won the Umno vice presidency with the highest number of votes.Then the reason how Isa won so impressively was revealed.Isa had spent tens of millions to buy votes and Zahid was one of his agents who spread the money around.But then Isa was found out and action was taken against him and he was suspended from the party for six years.But all that is water under the bridge and the reason we are talking about it is so that we can establish the link between Isa and Zahid, which goes back 12 years to 2004.That link was never severed.It continued until today and today Zahid is Isa’s link to Mahathir Mohamad--------interesting theory."

But Mahathir, if he agrees to accept Isa Samad, would have a very difficult time justifying such a move after all that he has said in the past.  So much so, that any gain by accepting Isa Samad would also come with a loss.  The loss would be greater than any gain."
