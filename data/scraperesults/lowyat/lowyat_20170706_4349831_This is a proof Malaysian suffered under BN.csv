BeastB,20170706,On my way,Group: Senior Member,Posts: 670,201105,,"BR1M is just a political gimmick to get votes. Anyone and everyone looking for a pathetic few hundred bucks from the government are either stupid or poor ppl mentality. You give someone a crutch, they automatically get weaker. Which is why a certain race today despite given so many crutches by government are losing to other races in highly competitive industries. How can a few hundred bucks make a difference to someone's life? They will spend it on bullshit, probably weed or splash it on a holiday. Makes no difference to quality of life. It's very sad how many people actually look forward to a 'handout' from government. Sorry I know I digressed from the topic but BR1M is such a scam and I'm shocked at the general mentality here of how they think the government is 'helping'."
