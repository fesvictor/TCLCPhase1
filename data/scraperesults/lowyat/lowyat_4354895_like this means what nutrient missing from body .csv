Ikruga,"  Jul 11 2017, 03:50 PM",Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 126,Joined: Jan 2009,,"Sorry, haven't tried it yet. In fact, BP offers a more comprehensive test, they call it Head2Toe, but it should include a metabolic blood test too. And they would require you to fast for a day prior to testing. Try sending them an enquiry.If I remember correctly it should cost around RM 120+. My senior colleague suggested it to me years ago, but I never got to do it because of procrastination."
