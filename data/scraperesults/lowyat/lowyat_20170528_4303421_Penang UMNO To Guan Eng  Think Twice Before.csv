Where is the money of the sold-out land, amounting RM12.5 billion gone?""How about the revenue from other sources of the state government?""Penangites do not understand based on what reasons Lim wanted to take a loan, which he claimed was less than RM1 billion, from a bank or financial institution from China,"" he said.Last Thursday, it was reported that the state government passed the Loan (Bank and Other Financial Souce) Enactment 2017 to allow it to borrow money from a bank or financial institution to pay for new public infrastructure and other projects.The enactment was seconded by Deputy Chief Minister I Mohd Rashid Hasnon (PKR-Pantai Jerejak) and it was unanimously passed after a two-hour debate involving 11 assembly members.Lim said the enactment was primarily to allow the state government to borrow money from the Export-Import Bank of China (Exim Bank of China) to finance the Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP).However, as per the Federal Constitution, the loan must be approved by the federal government. The federal laws also specify all states must repay their loans in five years.Zainal Abidin urged the state government to be transparent on why they planned to take a loan from an overseas bank.He said the state government should use the fund it had to carry out those new public infrastructures and other projects if the loan amount was only RM1 billion and below.He added the previous Barisan Nasional-led state government never took any loan from any financial institution and Lim should learn from the previous state government.In another development, Zainal Abidin said Umno Permatang Pauh division had the confidence to take back the tPermatang Pauh Parliamentary which the opposition party had taken for 18 years.He said Permatang Pauh people had voted based on sentiments in the past; however, some of the people had realised that they had been suffering losses all this while.""I hope the Permatang Pauh people do not cast their vote based on emotions and give an opportunity to BN's local candidate to serve them in next 14th General Election (GE14),"" he said.Zainal Abidin said he hoped there would be a one-to-one fight in the GE14.http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/05/28/...s-zainal-abidin"
