Kalau muktamar dan majlis syura buat keputusan, bukan setakat Selangor, kerusi di Kelantan seperti Tanah Merah, Machang dan beberapa tempat lain juga kita ambil,"" katanya.Ditanya peluang Pas untuk menang, Zuhdi berkata, parti itu mengharapkan tsunami politik Islam berlaku sebagaimana  momentum yang sama terjadi kepada masyarakat Cina pada PRU13 yang lalu.""kita akan menjana pengundi Islam, kalau PRU lalu, NGO Cina memberi sokongan, kita juga harap pada kali ini, NGO Islam, tokoh-tokoh agama boleh menjana Islam sekaligus memilih Pas.""Bagi kami empat atau lima negeri selain 40 kerusi kerusi parlimen seperti mana yang disebut Presiden Pas, kalau Umno masih memerintah, kita  akan jadi  'chek and balance' yang berkesan,"" katanya.sos"

If this event repeat in GE opposition would loose even more then just what pas has right now, for the fact that1. People give up on opposition for being weak and having no clear stand point of view, just like the previous GE.2. Not clear nor strong enough to be the new gov ..... all like warlords band together to fight against 1 unified party.Keeping them doesn't guarantee BeeNd will loose. In fact its the opposite .... as now part of a party that could turn anytime is taking guaranteed vote from the opposition.
