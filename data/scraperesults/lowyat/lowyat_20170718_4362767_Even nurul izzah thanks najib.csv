Radiant360,20170718,Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 156,201707,,It's not about what you have. Lrt is only cheap if you go alone. In group driving is still cheaper . Means if someone give you alot rubbish food you must appreciate and eat what on table? Only if you are poor. For ppl got motor or car lrt is not a solution.
