I can have no objection to that,” Mahathir was quoted as saying.In September 1998, Anwar was fired from his position as deputy prime minister as well as from Umno where he was deputy president. Mahathir was also Umno president at the time.Anwar was sentenced to six years in prison for corruption on April 14, 1999, and nine years in prison for sodomy on Aug 8, 2000.Human rights activists and the opposition heavily criticised the sentences, which were to be served consecutively, as being politically influenced by the Mahathir government.The Federal Court later overturned the sodomy conviction in September 2004 when Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was prime minister.In April 2009, Abdullah was succeeded by Najib Razak who has remained in power till today.In the latest case known as “Sodomy 2”, Anwar is serving a five-year jail term after losing his appeal at the Federal Court on Feb 10, 2015, to set aside his conviction on a charge of sodomising his former aide Mohd Saiful Bukhari Azlan in 2008.Azalina said as Anwar was now being punished under Section 377B of the Penal Code, there was no question of him being a victim of political vendetta this time as alleged by Mahathir.“Anwar Ibrahim has undergone every process as allowed under the law to defend himself, including presenting his appeal to the Board of Appeals,” she said.She said Mahathir’s allegation that there was interference in the decision on Anwar’s latest sodomy case directly questioned the freedom and integrity of the judiciary.“It is also an insult to the country’s legal and democratic systems,” she said.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...minds-mahathir/"

Kalau dia ikut perjalanan sama seperti mana pengganti saya sebelum ini, tidak ada U-turn, ia jalan lurus,"" katanya.Beliau berkata demikian selepas hadir pada satu majlis hari ini."
