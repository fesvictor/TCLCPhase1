They were sent to the Sultanah Bahiyah Hospital for treatment,"" said the officer who did not want to be named.The muktamar is expected to go on Sunday with its final day on Monday as the tent in which the meeting is held is not affected by the storm.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...sBUGlkK3bkTi.99"
