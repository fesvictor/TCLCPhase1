His lawyer arrived a few hours later.It is learnt the man was arrested a few hours into questioning. He will be remanded today.MACC deputy chief commissioner Datuk Azam Baki confirmed that the 54-year-old man turn himself in after lunchtime.Earlier in the day, Azam issued a warning, saying the man had until midnight to come forward, failing which his identity would be revealed.Azam, who was at the MACC excellent service award ceremony, said Immigration authorities had been asked to bar the man from leaving the country.Last Saturday, Sultan Ibrahim wrote on his official Facebook page that he was offered RM2mil to suggest a person’s name for a “Tan Sri” title.On Monday, the Johor Ruler granted an audience to MACC chief Datuk Dzulkifli Ahmad.Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...XTYFdsKW8cbf.99"
