ironmaid89,20170526,New Member,Group: Newbie,Posts: 0,201208,,"4N9lXiXRXIEUmno man shows up with a group of 'ghouls' at Election Commission office and accuses DAP's Ng Suee Lim of using phantom voters since the 11th general election.First it was showing up in nothing but a bath towel to protest water cuts in Selangor. Then he protested the mushrooming of massage parlours by parking 10 beds outside the Selangor secretariat building. His last gimmick involved a trail of caskets as he alleged the misuse of a senior citizens’ fund.Today, Umno Sungai Besar division chief Jamal Yunos showed he had no shortage of creative ideas when he presented himself at the office of the Election Commission along with a fright of “ghosts” to protest the existence of alleged phantom voters in the state constituency of Sekinchan.According to Jamal, phantom voters were supposedly brought in by Ng Suee Lim, the DAP assemblyman for the said constituency to ensure he won with a bigger majority.Truth be told, Jamal’s “phantoms” made a rather comedic lot with a dash of the macabre as most were decked in “blood-spattered” white shrouds, with some wearing garish, ghoulish masks.The spooky group was shuttled to the Election Commission office in a bus.At a press conference, Jamal alleged that the ferrying of phantom voters to several parts in Selangor – currently under the Pakatan Harapan – were a common occurrence since the country’s 11th general election.Jamal, who is the leader of the infamous Red Shirts, claimed that Ng, a three-term assemblyman, had roped in phantom voters to increase the majority of votes he garnered so as to retain his seat.“In the 11th GE, Ng won Sekinchan after obtaining a majority of several hundred votes. In the 12th GE he won with a majority of over three hundred votes.“Then in the 13th GE he obtained a majority of over 2,200,” Jamal said.Jamal later handed over a memorandum to protest Ng’s alleged use of phantom voters.In 2004, Ng defeated MCA’s Chia Chim Lem by 344 votes, while in the 12th GE in 2008 he retained Sekinchan after defeating MCA’s Puah Boon Choon with a 190 majority.In the 2013 elections however, Ng garnered 8,107 votes, while his opponent, MCA’s Kek Seng Hooi received 5,868 votes.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...rs-in-selangor/"

Also, you want protest massage parlors, again that's federal jurisdiction. You got balls, you set your beds up outside Bukit Aman lar and ask they they had so many top cops taking bribes to let it happen until the MACC had to investigate them."
