Vote yourself into the Government, don’t vote yourself out.“Vote MCA into the Government; use the government machinery to help you resolve your problems to deliver success for Malaysia,” said Liow.He added that MCA knew what the community wanted and the party would ensure there was continuous stability and development in Malaysia.“MCA is still very relevant as it works hand-in-hand with Umno and MIC for Malaysia. If we want a peaceful Malaysia, we need parties representing different races to work together,” he said.For the community, Liow said MCA had made concrete contributions.He cited the building of the Tunku Abdul Rahman University College, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman and Koperasi Jayadiri Malaysia Bhd as examples.He reiterated that MCA, being an inclusive and forward-looking party, had a multi-racial approach to politics to engage not just the Chinese, but also Malays, Indians and other races.“Being part of Barisan Nasional makes us less chauvinistic and more inclusive. We are very proud that this is the formula of Barisan’s success for our people to live in harmony and peace.“In the future, we want to continue to practise moderation and ensure Malaysia enjoys harmony and prosperity,” he said.In response to reporters’ questions, Liow said MCA had identified its weaknesses after the last election and strived for self-improvement and revitalisation.“We have been able to make structural changes and go through a self-cleansing process, which is crucial.“We are ready to move forward and inspire the Chinese community and rakyat that a revamped MCA is a strong MCA,” he said.As the general election is expected to be held this year, Liow said MCA had gone to the ground to engage the people and to relate its success stories.To clear confusion created by the Opposition’s cyber troopers, Liow said MCA had to focus on explanation and letting the people know that social media should be a channel for constructive criticism to take the country forward.“The Opposition, especially DAP, has lost a lot of credibility,” he said.On Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang’s Private Member’s Bill, Liow said a legal team of MCA and representatives from Chinese organisations and associations had drafted a memorandum on the issue.The MCA chief will hand over this memorandum to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and the Cabinet.On the mega rally planned by PAS on Feb 18 to show support for the Bill, Liow said the gathering had to follow the right procedures in accordance with the Peaceful Assembly Act.He stressed that MCA’s stance on RUU355 had not wavered, regardless of which political parties would participate in the rally.“We will vehemently oppose it as it is running against the Federal Constitution,” he said.Liow said that instead of putting the blame on MCA, DAP’s Lim Kit Siang should admit that it was DAP that had strengthened PAS by misleading the Chinese community into supporting PAS.“DAP should accept the challenge to stop PAS pushing for Hadi’s Bill. However, we still see it cooperating closely with PAS in the Selangor state assembly,” he said."
