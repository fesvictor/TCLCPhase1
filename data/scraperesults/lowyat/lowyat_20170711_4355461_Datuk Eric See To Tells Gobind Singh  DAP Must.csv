GE13 was held on May 5, 2013.Prior to GE13, DAP held its CEC elections in December, 2012, only about two and a half months before the fifth anniversary of GE12.“It is now early July 2017, which is nine months before early May 2018, the fifth anniversary of GE13,” he added.See-To challenged DAP CEC member Gobind Singh Deo to explain how the RoS is sabotaging DAP's general election preparations.In its July 7 statement, the RoS said its decision was made following complaints lodged by DAP members themselves.RoS also deemed that the re-election in 2013 was not carried out, based on the list of delegates authorised to attend and vote in the earlier polls held on Dec 15, 2012.If DAP does not abide by the RoS’ instruction, the party would not be able to nominate candidates to contest in GE14.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017...y3QzXMZTPctv.99"
