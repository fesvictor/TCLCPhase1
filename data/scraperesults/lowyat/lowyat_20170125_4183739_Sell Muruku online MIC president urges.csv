Subramaniam urged Indian youths to venture into the field of information technology, which has many opportunities to offer.“For example, via e-Commerce, maybe we can sell muruku online rather than the traditional way. It will also provide additional revenue,” he said.Dr Subramaniam, who is also the Minister of Health, said anti-social activities among Indian youth need to be addressed and as a leader, he must figure out the best way to develop and harvest the group’s potential.It is feared that if allowed to participate in these unhealthy activities they will jeopardise their future, reported Bernama.“What I’m visualising is activities such as sports. For example, a group of young Indians joined the Malaysian Indian Football Association (Mifa), they highlighted their potential by winning the FAM Cup (Football Association of Malaysia) and I can see that they have a bright future in sports.“Secondly, they can be involved in cultural activities such as singing … many have already become professional singers,” he was quoted as saying by Bernama.He said this in his speech at the 60th anniversary celebration of the Malaysian Tamil Youth Bell Club (KKBT) at The Grand Hall in LukuT, Port Dickson, yesterday.The celebration was officiated by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak and was attended by Negri Sembilan Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan, Speaker Dewan Negara Datuk Seri S.A. Vigneswaran, MyPPP president Tan Sri M. Kayveas, former MIC president Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu, Gerakan vice-president Datuk A. Kohilan Pillay and KKBT president K. Murali.Meanwhile, Mohamad in his speech also said today’s youth were fortunate because the National Transformation Programme 2050 (TN50) launched by the government takes into account what the youth have to say, their views and what they want.TN50 envisioned by the prime minister is a futuristic policy for the country’s roadmap in the next 30 years after 2020.Murali had earlier pledged that KBBT comprising 24,552 members nationwide will fully support TN50.http://www.themalaysiantimes.com.my/mic-pr...fiqs4g.facebook"
