The people don't want another Umno in Pakatan Harapan,"" Loke said during a press conference held at Parliament's media centre here.He was commenting on Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) President Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin's suggestion for a dominant Malay party to lead Pakatan Harapan.Loke however said DAP will discuss the matter with PKR, Amanah and PPBM in the coalition's first meeting after PPBM officially joined the pact last Monday.""All component parties are equal, where every idea will be discussed but not all will be accepted.""We are open to suggestions. We are prepared to talk and discuss any suggestions by PPBM. But of course (we) will have our argument(s); not all suggestions by PPBM will be accepted,"" he said."

joe_mamak,20170327,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"You could have also used the Swiss Federation example.  They are not communist in anyway.  But noo.......   Aiyah.  It won't be perfect lah.  But what this Loke chap said is pretty close to it.  PH is made up of more or less equals.  Like PR before.  If there was one big dominant party in PR, the selection of the new MB for Selangor wouldn't have been so messy.  PKR wanted a new one.  PAS didn't agree.  DAP caught unaware but later went along with PKR.  If there was a dominant party in PR, that wouldn't have happened.  PSThat actually sounds like a coalition of equal powers, not coalition of equals."

iconia17,20170327,New Member,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 7,201211,,"Theoretically that can be done with rotational leadership. Top pengerusi become the prime minister if they win. So in order for it to work and no future problem arise, pakatan need a black and white agreement and register their association with ROS. Wth perlembagaan, rules, all those binding things like BN.Realistically though, if dap turn come to hold the pengerusi seat, can ppbm amanah and pkr and even the muslim who vote them allow non muslim pm or dpm if they win federal election?No way at least for 100 years. So no way they would be able to register pakatan properly as one entity. The only way is to make it compulsory for either one of amanah, ppbm and pkr to rotate the leadership. Dap would never hold the pengerusi seat. So if it goes that way, no such thing as equality anymore. Again its BN 2.0.They all know that and thats why there is no black and white for pakatan. Today can be 4 party tomorrow can easily be just 2 party. If i dont like your view i can just pull out."
joe_mamak,20170327,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"That's why.  It is actually a non-issue.  LGE and LKS (IIRC) both said they don't want to be PM.  Or maybe even DPM.  PH needs to focus on getting the message out, getting to Putrajaya is more important."

joe_mamak,20170327,Casual,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 333,200612,,"I read here and there. Yes, all that was agreed.  But it hasn't been decided what would the new name be.  Muhyiddin proposed Barisan Rakyat only yesterday.  It was a proposal.  Lim Guan Eng said he would consult other partners before giving an opinion.  He didn't reject it outright.  Those two articles, one by Stephen Ng and the other by Timmy Say; they appear to be writers or contributors to MalaysiaKini and Free Malaysiatoday respectively.  Are they opposition supporters, highly likely.  But are they card carrying members, I don't know.  It is the parties that get to decide.  Most of us are just supporters, by the sidelines.  So, I think you might have missed something."
