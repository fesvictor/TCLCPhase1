Road shoulders and drains were not built. There were potholes, uneven and muddy road surfaces in certain stretches of the road project from Pekan Belaga to Mejawah, Belaga....The procurement for these project were conducted through ‘direct negotiation’ between the Defence Ministry’s Development Division and selected contractors, all of which were approved by the Finance Ministry....The report did not name these contractors...A Bernama report last month quoted Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi as saying that RM743 million had been allocated to JMP to build more roads in the rural areas of Sarawak.vs.‘Less than satisfactory’ works means waste of public fund — Baruborneo post 20 May 2016 SoS...State PKR chairman Baru Bian said based on the AG’s report that was tabled in Parliament on Wednesday, it was very clear that the projects were implemented without quality and standard....When contacted yesterday, Baru alleged that the projects were directly negotiated which could contain elements of corruption and that the roads built were unsafe....Baru, who was re-elected Ba Kelalan assemblyman in the just concluded election, recalled that last November, he had described the condition of the Long Lopeng to Ba Kelalan road as ‘the hole-iest road in Malaysia’.vs. ?????RM24.8 billion needed to build roads to over 1,000 rural villages by 2030 — Masingborneo post 25 May 2016 SoS...Responding to re-elected Ba Kelalan assemblyman Baru Bian’s statement that the RM253 million spent by the Defence Ministry to implement 11 Jiwa Murni projects in Sarawak was a waste of public funds following the ‘less than satisfactory’ quality of work revealed in the Auditor-General’s report, Masing said priority was given to create connectivity....“To me, connectivity is very important.
