Unless he receives a royal pardon, he will be barred from contesting an election for five years, even after his release from prison.“What if Anwar loses the election? What if Anwar cannot be the prime minister for health reasons?” Wan Saiful said.“It is a collective decision of the coalition. You cannot play around with it.”He agreed with Mahathir’s decision not to hold up the “Anwar for PM” placard as the PH presidential council had not made any decision regarding the prime minister’s post.He said making Anwar the next prime minister was the agenda of only PKR.“You cannot force the other parties to support your agenda without discussing it first,” he said."

This is the definition of government. The governments job is to criticise opposition, just like its the oppositions job to criticise the government."
