When we submitted our constitution, we did not list the names of who holds what positions, we only put in the positions themselves,” Dr Mahathir said when asked about the position of de facto leader or ketua umum.Anwar is barred from holding any position as he is currently serving a jail term for sodomy.“For now there is no objection from the RoS and we hope it will approve our application,” Dr Mahathir said."
