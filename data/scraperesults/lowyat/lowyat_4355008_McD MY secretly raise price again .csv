Last time got launch/dinner set still ok, now stupid mix and match means u paying for the same price for a small set if take same item by item as previous lunch/dinner set. McD can go die.There is better burger and chicken elsewhere with far better value. If i eat at Texas and paying extra 1 or 2 ringgit more than McD yet can hav unlimited refill, big portion of burger and big piece of ayam, why should i go McD?"

neoexcaliber,"  Jul 11 2017, 03:44 PM",Getting Started,Group: Junior Member,Posts: 67,Joined: Jan 2005,,There's one item that reduced in price though and I'm assuming it's because they screwed up the calculation previously. Upgrading from coffee/tea to soya used to 90 cents extra but now it's 30 cents. I doubt McD is generous so I'm assuming I was careless previously. I don't have an issue with the price but the drive through speed is infuriating. So infuriating that I wish it was banned.
