Topic title: 防止 paywave 卡被盗读的简单方法

老何,20170124,"现在银行所新发出的 debit card 或 credit card 都会有 paywave 的功能。其实说穿了 paywave 所使用的技术就是 RFID。或许你不知道什么是 RFID。 简单来说 paywave 就是和 Touch and Go 卡的技术是一样的。Smart tag 就是一个 RFID reader。铝箔纸或铁丝网可以阻挡电磁波启动 RFID。将一片铝箔纸放在钱包里就可以防止 paywave 卡被盗读。我很懒惰，只是折了一片纸钞大小的 size，然后放在钱包最外的一个隔间就完工了。就是那么简单的方法而已。以前要用卡时我是将整个钱包放在 card reader 上，现在我要用卡时就必需将卡拿出来才能嘟得过。不要小看铝箔纸。它连手机的讯号都可以隔开来。只要你将手机包上一层的铝箔纸（薄薄的一层就好），那架手机就打不通了。RFID 卡上的晶片是属于 passive circuit 。Card reader 发送的电磁波足够启动 RFID 上的晶片来传输出资料的话，card reader 就能够读取卡上的资料。低效率的 card reader 如 smart tag 或者电话上的 NFC 功能必需贴紧着卡才能读到卡上的资料。高效率的 card reader 如某些 gated community 的 boom gate, 不需要开车窗隔着1～2米的距离也是可以读取门卡的资料然后打开 boom gate。早些前所流传出说 1 meter 也可以盗读卡上的资料确实是可以办到的，只要加大antenna 的电线圈数和提高 power wattage就可以办到。但是加大 power wattage 的坏处是全部的 RFID卡会同时发送资料而造成 interference 读不到资料，相等于你拿两张 touch and Go 卡贴在 smart tag 上时就读不到资料。15年前在 3310的风靡全球的年代还有防手机辐射的贴纸。其实说穿了那张贴纸就只不过是一张有胶片的铝箔纸。"

老何,20170125,"不是的。ERP 机读不到你的卡相等于你的车没有佩戴 Cashcard 然后闯过 ERP 没有缴费。车主会收到 LTA 的“情信”。"

老何,20170125,"有几种。第一种就是银行卡的个别套套。Rm5~6 一个。第二中是可以摆放8～10张卡的 hardcase 壳。Rm10~12 一个。第三中就是有铁丝网的钱包。Rm200~500 一个。外表和一般钱包一样。不过里面的夹层不是铝箔纸。它里面有一层很细幼的铁丝网来隔开电磁波。那铁丝网看是半透明的。都说我很吝啬的咯。现在用着的钱包好好的叫我舍弃掉然后专门买个 RFID proof 的钱包，我怎么舍得叻。老婆送的礼物都快用10年了，有感情的叻。"

chiobu,20170429,"5 myths about contactless paymentshttp://canada.creditcards.com/cr ... payment-myths-1264/ Fear. That's the emotion viewers often experience after watching media demonstrations, such as this one by CBC News, that show how easily criminals can electronically pickpocket unsuspecting cardholders.Many Canadians are not well-versed in contactless payment technology, intensifying that fear. A few consumers are not happy that banks no longer offer a credit card without a radio-frequency chip, says Financial Consumer Agency of Canada representative Julie Hauser. Others are concerned about the safety and security of contactless technology.Separating the myths from the facts may help reduce the fear about contactless payment technology.contactless-paymentHow contactless card transactions workIt's a complicated process, but we'll break it down for you. See how contactless payments work.RFID versus NFCSome concerns may arise from perplexing terminology. Even experts confuse the terms Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC). Both refer to the transfer of information from a card or device to a reader via radio-frequency technology.United Kingdom-based security consultant Adam Laurie explains that RFID usually describes low-frequency 'dumb' (one-way communication) applications such as door entry systems. Another U.K. expert, hardware engineer and software developer Bill Ray, says RFID has no security and a super-powerful reader can reach an RFID tag from a mile or more away.In contrast, Visa payWave, MasterCard PayPass and American Express ExpressPay adhere to NFC, a wireless radio communications standard that contactless credit cards use for very short-range transactions.Catherine Johnston, president and CEO of the Advanced Card Technology Association of Canada, agrees that NFC is completely different from RFID technology. RFID is a technology that is meant to say ‘Hi, here I am -- look at me!' whereas NFC and contactless technology is designed to say, ‘I'm not talking to you until I know you're someone I should talk to.'Laurie acknowledges that, despite the contrasts between the two technologies, RFID has become synonymous with NFC as an accepted industry term. The misnomer brings us to our first misconception.Myth No. 1: Electronic thieves can steal card data from a distanceNFC credit cards must tap or almost touch the processing terminal. As the term 'Near Field Communication' [implies], the field for signal transmission is very narrow, up to a maximum of 4 centimeters with very few exceptions, says Anthony Palermo, director of business development at the Academia RFID Centre of Excellence.Systems consultant Joe Mante notes that anything is possible, but says the cost of developing a portable NFC reader powerful enough to remotely intercept card data is prohibitively expensive at this time.Myth No. 2: Contactless cards continuously emit radio wavesA contactless card only becomes active after receiving a ‘wake-up signal' from a reader on the same frequency as the card. The chip inside a contactless card has no battery, so it can't do anything on its own. Ray explains the powered reader must first supply electro-magnetic energy to the contactless card, a triggering action that then establishes a radio connection between the card and the reader.Having to lug around a battery-powered reader also constrains the time available for an electronic pickpocket to scan potential victims' wallets or purses.Myth No. 3: Contactless cards are easily duplicatedAnother type of technology, the EMV chip, has made it much harder to duplicate any kind of credit card in Canada. EMV, which stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa -- the companies that back the standard -- was first introduced to Canadians in 2007. The so-called chip and PIN cards are now in mass circulation and provide fraud protection features superior to magnetic stripe cards.Magnetic stripe cards can be easily duplicated in part because they send unencrypted data back to a reader. According to Laurie, this can result in counterfeit card purchases. Data from the magnetic stripe can be captured, encoded on a magnetic stripe and then ‘replayed' to another terminal, which will honour the transaction, he says.Johnston, who has worked in the card transactions area since 1989, agrees. The reason a chip makes so much sense is that the chip itself enforces rules and is part of the security tools, which a magnetic stripe is not capable of doing, says Johnston.Canadian chip and PIN cards are also more secure for electronic transactions conducted over an NFC connection. Ray says contactless payments involve a challenge/response mechanism that is effectively impossible to duplicate.Myth No. 4: Contactless cards are vulnerable to identity theftContactless smart cards are not impervious to electronic attacks. Placing a portable reader within centimeters of a victim's wallet might enable a hacker to intercept the card number and expiry date, concedes Palermo. However, the amount of usable cardholder information that can be electronically snagged is limited.An identity thief would not be able to capture the cardholder's name, PIN, or the security code fraudsters would need for most online purchases.Simply by snapping a photo of the credit card instead, a criminal could capture the card number, expiry date and often the cardholder's name.Myth No. 5: Electronic pickpocketing involves big-dollar theftsAsked about the magnitude of financial damages electronic pickpocketing causes in Canada, Johnston says there aren't huge losses.Somebody does something in a very controlled environment, and then reports that they've broken the security of a card chip, she says, referring to media demonstrations. Then we investigate the claim and conclude that's not true.In fact, there are no reports of this type of criminal fraud taking place, Visa Canada spokeswoman Carla Hindman wrote in an email. Criminals typically focus on high-value fraud that can easily be converted to cash. Based on information from their respective websites, the transaction limit for a MasterCard PayPass and Visa payWave is $50. American Express's online FAQ section lists a $25 cap for ExpressWay transactions without a signature. These low transaction amounts make it harder for criminals to score quick money via contactless card crimes.Major credit card companies provide consumers with protection against fraud through their no-liability public commitment policies, advises Hauser on the issue of consumer protection.These commitments apply to traditional and contactless credit card transactions and ensure that consumers are not held liable for losses resulting from unauthorized transactions.See related: Chip technology: A win-lose proposition?; 4 things you need to know about PayPass technology "
