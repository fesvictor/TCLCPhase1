Each criteria fulfilled by consumers will qualify them for a RM60 discount on their monthly bill. - For sublines, webe has tiered pricing available – the second subsequent line will receive RM10 off their bill making it as low as RM69 per month; the third line will receive an RM20 off their bill, making it as low as RM59 per month; the fourth and fifth line will both receive RM30 off their bill, making it as low as RM49 per month. - You will be charged an upfront enabling fee of RM100 (RM106 inclusive of GST) that will be offset in your first bill when you subscribe to webe plan.2.When is webe going to open to public?- We have opened up our service for public subscription beginning 30 September 2016.3.Why is tethering not included in the subscription?- webe has always been about doing things differently from the beginning and this also means we take a different view in terms of how we bill. - As a community-focused brand, we put customer experience at our forefront. Our promise together with never-ending data, calls and SMS is that of a seamless digital experience,without any throttling beyond a certain quota. This is dedicated to customers with simple pricing, as low as RM79 – to allow the worry-free experience exclusively for our members when experiencing our network, and that is our priority. - However, to tether and share this never-ending data, we will have to charge you RM6.00 (RM6.36 including GST) for 2 hours.- This is how we do things differently and allows us to ensure an uncompromised experience for all webe members because as a community-led brand, we believe in equitable usage for all.4.What is your coverage like?- webe has nationwide coverage - within the areas of the Klang Valley, Penang and JB, webe is sufficiently covered by 4G LTE. Beyond these areas are 3G and 2G. - We are continuously expanding our LTE areas and will be updating our members via our online portal at www.webe.com.my under the support tab.5.What are the speeds like for your 4G LTE?- Speeds, caps and quota are a language of the past which we tend to try not to focus on. - This is because when we began this journey of redefining mobility, we spoke to consumers about what they ideally wanted out of a mobile services plan. The insights indicated that beyond speeds, it would be never-ending data and what they would be able to do with it. 6.What is a webe certified phone?- A webe certified phone is a smartphone that has been tested to ensure the best quality experience on webe network. - webe mobile services can be used on all phone models, however, we encourage our members to use a webe certified phone to experience the best quality of service.- During registration, members can choose to purchase a webe certified phone together with their mobile service plan at a discounted rate as well as immediately qualifying for the rebate criteria. - Important Note: Members have a choice of not purchasing these phones when subscribing to the plans; although if they do, they can get great discounts.
