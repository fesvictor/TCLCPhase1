科学就是未来,20170818,"不懂是中国报的翻译出问题，还是中文写作有问题，感觉第一段就有误导的感觉看原文http://bernama.com/bernama/v8/newsindex.php?id=1383141PUTRAJAYA, Aug 18 (Bernama) -- Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak today launched a programme aimed at enhancing bumiputera involvement in careers providing a monthly income exceeding RM20,000.The Super High Income Programme (SHIP) would focus on middle-income earners with relevant working experience, he said at the launch after chairing a meeting of the Bumiputera Education Leadership Foundation.Najib said the focus would be on industries that needed skilled and professional manpower, such as the financial services industry, business services, health, maritime and aerospace.Such a high income can be achieved through specialised training and certification in the selected fields, he said.The Prime Minister said the courses under Bank Rakyat financing would be for a duration of between three and five years.He said applications for participation would open at the end of the year, and the first phase would involve 50 beneficiaries with a maximum financing of RM10 million in the financial services, health and technology industries.The following phase will start in 2018 with the introduction of more areas of expertise and industries in stages and involve 250 recipients, he added.Najib said an incentive would be given for the programme participants, with those completing the specialisation course considered for a maximum 20 per cent reduction in the loan.Those interested could obtain more information on the programme at the website of the Bumiputera Education Leadership Foundation, he said.Najib also said that the Bumiputera Education Leadership Foundation was on the right track in the quest to develop bumiputera talents through the financing of three programmes - Peneraju Tunas, Peneraju Skil and Peneraju Profesional.He said the foundation achieved the target of developing more than 16,000 bumiputera talents through more than 200 programmes with funding of RM435 million.This means that 40 per cent of the target to develop 40,000 bumiputera talents by 2020 has been achieved. At the end of this year, this number will increase to 20,000 as targeted, he said.Najib said the meeting today also discussed the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) that had been achieved, and there had been quantum leaps in some areas.Citing an example, he said the rate of employment of the beneficiaries had risen to 90 per cent compared to 77 per cent in the previous year.At the event, Najib launched the second edition of the foundation magazine #iniceritasaya which is a collection of stories of the aspirations and success of young people.He said the second edition of #iniceritasaya proved that young people were able to achieve their ambitions as well as inspire the public with their success stories.Najib urged youths to take on the challenge of raising their income and careers through the programmes conducted by the foundation.Although it is moderate, the beneficiaries are able to achieve their dreams because the government of today is concerned about their future. The Bumiputera Education Leadership Foundation gives new hope to the recipients, he said.Minister in the Prime Minister's Department and chairman of the foundation executive committee Datuk Seri Abdul Rahman Dahlan and foundation chief executive Raja Azura Raja Mahayuddin were also present at the event.关于这个所谓的“土著高薪计划”，大致上的意思就是，推介最新的土著再学习计划，以让中等收入的有技能和相关领域的土著，尤其是专业领域的金融业，商业服务业（包含市场行销，广告，专业质询，运输等），医疗保健，海事，和航空业，让这些人经过3-5年的特别课程后可以进入高薪领域，拿超过两万薪水的工作。这些特别课程由bank rakyat 提供金钱服务，完成课程者可以拿最多20% 的贷款折扣。"
科学就是未来,20170818,"这个计划是，要贷款修读课程，而且要是相关领域的专业中等收入土著，而且要向bank rakyat 拿金钱服务，完成课程后有最多20% 折扣，到时是以你专业文凭去相关领域找工，整个计划是在再培养土著精英。"

科学就是未来,20170818,"其实是土著精英版的ptptn, 由银行负责贷款。到时不是随随便便可以像ptptn 这样赖着不给钱，这些特别课程，贷款肯定超过可以被起诉破产的数额，而且是target 有技能的土著中等收入者，这类人被告破产，他们连出国旅行机会都没有。"

科学就是未来,20170818,"暂时是有限制科系，几个专业领域里面，是先选金融，医疗保健和科技业。再加上是Bank Rakyat 出贷款，那些中等收入者如果跑去读那些不能赚大钱的行业，到时银行收不回钱，银行死中等收入者也死。这个贷款Subs 给银行，就是要把追债责任完全法律化，如果是政府发贷款，到时候追回贷款时肯定被有心人拿来炒作。He said applications for participation would open at the end of the year, and the first phase would involve 50 beneficiaries with a maximum financing of RM10 million in the financial services, health and technology industries.The following phase will start in 2018 with the introduction of more areas of expertise and industries in stages and involve 250 recipients, he added."
