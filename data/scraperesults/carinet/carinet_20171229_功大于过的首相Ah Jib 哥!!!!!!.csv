家驹,20171229,"不论是当年任至教育部长或现今任职首相，他－纳吉，仍然是史无前例最亲近华社的领袖&#128077; 关于首相纳吉－你必须知道的事❗️Facts you MUST KNOW about PM Najib ❗️&#128073;废除教育法 安华拒绝&#128073;批新建及搬迁16华小 &#128073;签名批准，史无前例&#128073;助非巫裔争地建廉屋-----------马华元老丹斯里林亚礼分享首相拿督斯里纳吉在过去担任彭亨州务大臣和教育部长时，作出许多对华教有利的决定，但却因无人知晓，以致偶尔被人误解。《星报》报道了林亚礼分享纳吉从政40年来，作出有利华教的决定，并强调他希望人民，尤其是华社能更了解纳吉。他指出，纳吉最重大决定，就是废除《1961年教育法令》第21（2）条文，放弃他关闭华校和将国民型小学改为国民小学的权力。“但是讽刺的是，许多华裔年轻人并不知道这段历史，反之将（国会前反对党领袖）安华依布拉欣视为偶像，熟不知安华在担任教育部长时，拒绝了华社提出废除这项条文的呼吁。“实际上，安华还指示各州教育局，将所有学校保留地，全保留给国民学校。而他最具争议性的举措，就是委派不谙华语的校长前往华校任职。”林亚礼也提到1999年全国大选的提名前夕，时任教育部长的纳吉批准新建和搬迁华小的事情。“那时我是人资部长，他（纳吉）是教育部长。在提名日的前一天，他的办公室挤满人，但是他把时间空出来给我。我拿着一份由（拿督斯里）廖中莱（当时为林亚礼政治秘书）准备的备忘录，申请批准新建和搬迁16所华小。“他仔细地看了有关的名单，然后就在每份申请下，签名批准。这是史无前例的，就在短短的20分钟内完成。”他说，纳吉之后问他还有其他事情吗？他就趁机向纳吉提出，柔州宽柔独中要扩建校舍的要求。其实，扩建校舍就同等于是建立分校。“我问问纳吉，是否也能批准这项扩建申请。他再次拿出了他的笔，签名批准。”林亚礼也提及，纳吉在担任彭亨州大臣时候，马兰马华区会曾有一次遇到阻碍，因有一片要用来兴建廉价房屋的土地，被列为马来保留地，意味着这片土地无法用来兴建房屋。他说，他将此事知会纳吉，而纳吉马上向土地局官员查询，得知这片土地已经颁布宪报为马来保留地。“他向我道歉，并表示会落实两全其美的方案。最终，这片土地有部分被区分出来，还给非巫裔继续兴建廉价房屋。”他也说道，首相纳吉当年在担任彭州大臣时，也曾拨款200万令吉给彭州新村，是首开先例的做法。林亚礼强调，当时的纳吉才29岁，但是这并没有阻止他，在一个以马来人占大多的州属，为帮助华裔而作出大胆的决定。-----------MCA veteran Tan Sri Lim Ah Lek has a record which not many party politicians can claim – the silver-haired retired politician has served under Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak as a state executive councillor and beside him as a Cabinet colleague.Ah Lek tells he wants to share his experiences on Najib to fill up the gaps in history, which needs to be recorded, as Najib marks his 40 years in politics.He adds that there were many decisions made by Najib that had benefitted Chinese education, but were little known, and as a result, Najib was sometimes a misunderstood man.“I am not here to suck up to Najib. I am a retired man and I don’t need any rewards or awards from him or the government.“I just want the people, especially the Chinese community, to know this man better,” he says.image: https://www.thestar.com.my/…/main_2802_wcforty_zh_11pdf.ash…Tan Sri Lim Ah LekThe biggest decision Najib made as Education Minister was to give up his power – as then provided for under Section 21(2) of the Education Act 1961 – to close down Chinese schools and convert them to national schools, Ah Lek highlights.“He voluntarily gave up that authority and removed the uncertainties that used to hang above the heads of the Chinese community.“The irony is that many young Chinese, who don’t know the nation’s history, have idolised Anwar Ibrahim not knowing that when he was education minister, he rejected the community’s call to remove that power.“In fact, he also directed all state education departments to allocate land reserved for schools to national schools only. His most controversial act was to send non-Chinese speaking headmasters to Chinese schools.“He will be remembered as the education minister who publicly announced that he was giving only RM10 to Chinese schools.“These are not made up by me. They were well reported in the media.“The young just need to Google and check what I have said. In fact, he also reportedly ordered the crosses in mission schools to be removed.”In another case during Najib’s tenure as MB, says Ah Lek, the Maran MCA division had run into a snag when a piece of land, meant for a low-cost housing project, ended up as a Malay reserve land.“That meant that the Chinese and other races would never be able to build any homes. When they applied for that land, it was not a Malay reserve land.“I took the matter to Najib and showed him the facts.“He immediately called up the district officer and was told that it had indeed been gazetted as a Malay reserve land.“He apologised and said he would work out a compromise, and the land was eventually partially returned to non-Malays to continue building the low-cost homes,” Ah Lek said.Ah Lek says Najib had acted swiftly and fairly despite being a young MB who had to face the wrath of the local Malay politicians and voters, but he always believed in the politics of consensus.“Najib, as a MB then, sought my views on how best to resolve this issue as a senior member of exco.“I suggested to de-gazatte and apportion 30% as non-Malay land so that other races can apply.“Najib instructed me to write in officially. I did the appeal letter and submitted it to Najib the next day. Najib very swiftly approved the appeal the very same day.Ah Lek wanted the Chinese community to know that Najib, as MB, created a RM2mil allocation specifically for the 49 Chinese new villages in the state.“It had never been done before.“He was the first. He stated clearly that the money was for development in new villages,” he says.Adds Ah Lek, Najib also converted the temporary occupation licensed (TOL) land owned by Chinese farmers into a 99-year-old leasehold land at 50 sen per sq ft.“We are talking about a young MB here, just 29 years old, but it didn’t deter him from making the bold decisions to help the Chinese in a Malay majority state.”The former MCA deputy president says that when he decided not to seek re-election in the 1999 general election, he had gone on to complete some unfinished business for Chinese schools, which he was entrusted by the MCA to handle despite his English education background.“Our offices at Pusat Bandar Damansara (where the ministries were then located) were just next to each other. I was Human Resources Minister and he was Education Minister.“I had announced my retirement and had spoken about going on holiday.“It was the eve of nomination and his office was packed with party supporters and workers. It was standing room only.“But he had time for me. I went to see him, holding a memorandum, prepared by (Datuk Seri) Liow Tiong Lai (his then political secretary) to appeal for 16 new Chinese schools to be newly approved or to be relocated.“It had been left unattended because of bureaucracy. He looked at the list, one by one, and put his signature as approval for every application.“With a stroke, he approved the largest number of Chinese schools – 16 schools got new approval and relocation.“It was unprecedented and all done in 20 minutes. He then looked at me and asked if there was anything more.“Taking the opportunity, I realised that on the way to see Najib, I had encountered a group of people from the prominent Foon Yew independent school in Johor Baru, who was desperate to see him to get approval for an extension. It was actually more of a branch school.“I told Najib that if he would also kindly approved that extension. He took out his pen again, scribbled on the same memorandum and approved it.“When I left his office, I told the waiting group of Foon Yew officials that there was no need for them to see Najib as he had also approved their school extension. You should have seen the joy on their faces.“The move for a branch Chinese school was also an unprecedented decision, initiated by Najib.”Ah Lek believes it is important that these decisions are made known to the public so that they can appreciate Najib’s term as an MB.“Politics is about perception, rightly or wrongly.“Often, an outspoken politician is perceived as a hero even though he talks more than he contributes.“He may have zero contribution, but because of his rhetoric, those who actually helped develop Chinese education are not recognised or worse, dismissed with scorn.“Emotions often take over rationality.“With a shrinking population, I pray that the Chinese voters would re-assess their political thinking and vote cleverly and strategically.“We can still retain our political clout, even with our smaller numbers, if we are able to place ourselves cleverly, or else, our clout will be greatly reduced along with our shrinking numbers if we live by wishful thinking without being politically realistic.”"
