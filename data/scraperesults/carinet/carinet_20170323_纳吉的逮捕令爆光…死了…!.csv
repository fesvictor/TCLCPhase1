Gani PatailSarawak Report has acquired documents, now verified, whichexplain exactly why Abdul Gani Patail was dramatically fired onMonday.The Attorney General was on the brink of bringing charges forcorruption against the Prime Minister of Malaysia.We have acquired the secret documents, which Gani Patail was inthe process of drafting.They include a charge sheet for corrupt practices under Section17 (a) of the MACC Act, allowing for punishment of a sentence of upto 20 years in prison under Section 24 of the Act.In an unprecedented situation the person being charged was noneother than the Prime Minister 「Dato Seri Mohd Najib Bin Tun AbdulRazak」 along with a company director, Dato Shamus Anuar BinSulaiman.The explosive information hits Malaysia in the middle of ahighly controversial visit by the British Prime Minister, who hadbeen widely warned against making such a visit in the midst ofMalaysia biggest political scandal in decades.The documents, which were being worked in their final draftstages by the Attorney General, were sent to Sarawak Reportfollowing the sacking of Gani Patail and have now been verified byother senior parties.Arrest Warrant for a Prime Minister!In English the first of two draft warrants spell out the chargesbeing brought by Malaysias most senior law officer (who wasunconstitutionally dismissed by the Prime Minister the day afterthese drafts were printed).The warrant cites that the Prime Minister and Shamsul Anuar and「another person still at large Nik Ariff Bin Faisla Kamil」 on 26thof December 2014 at the AmIslamic Bank, Bangunan Ambank Group inKuala Lumpur, as an agent of the Malaysian Government, namely thePrime Minister of Malaysia and special advisor of SRCInternational, did secretly obtain a sum of money amounting to RM27million that was paid through the company Gandingan Mentari andIhsan Perdana to 「your account at AmPrivate Banking -1MY no211201101880″ with the principal aim of obtaining a loan fromKumpulan Wang Persaraan pension fund.「As such you have committed an offence under Section 17(1) ofthe Malaysian Anti-Corruption Act of 2009, under which you can bepunished according to Section 24 of the Act, to be read withSection 34″.The punishment cited at the base of the document is imprisonmentof not more than 20 years and a fine not less than five times ofthe value of the bribe taken or RM10,000, whichever is higher.Raiding Malaysias public pension fund KWAP!The crime referred to has already been widely reported followingexposes by Sarawak Report and the Wall Street Journal at the startof this month.We produced documents from the task force investigation into1MDB, which showed that its former subsidiary SRC International(whose CEO is Nik Kamil) had made a number of payments into thePrime Ministers personal accounts totalling millions of ringgitover a period from last December to this February.The payments went through the companies Gandingan Menteri SdnBhd, of whom the Director was Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil (also wantedfor questioning) and Ihsan Perdana Sdn Bhd, whose Director ShamusAnuar is also cited in the warrant.The route of the money referred to in the chargesCriminal Breech of TrustA second, alternative draft charge was being worked on by theAttorney General, which Sarawak Report has also obtained.The second charge relates to the same act on the same day, butrefers more specifically to the Prime Ministers position of trustwith regard to the company SRC. In English it reads:「SecretThe first draft of the charge (alternative)That you on 26.12.2014 in AmIslamic Bank Berhad, AmBank GroupBuilding, No. 55 Jalan Raja Chulan, Kuala Lumpur Federal Territoryas an agent, as Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Malaysia andSpecial Adviser (Emeritus Advisor) Company SRC International SdnBhd which in that capacity, is entrusted with the control of thefund company, has criminal breach of trust funds, namelydishonestly disposing of SRC International Sdn Bhd Company amountedRM27juta to your account AmPrivate Banking-1MY no. 2112022011880coupling Mentari Sdn Bhd Corporate and Company Ihsan Perdana SdnBhd. Therefore you committed the offense and punishable taken ofSection 409 of the Penal Code, read together with section 34 of thePenal CodePenalties:Sabit errors can be jailed for a minimum of 2 years and amaximum of 20 years and with whipping, and a fine.Headquarters Complaint No. AU / Rpt No. 252/2015Sacked!A close insider has now confirmed to Sarawak Report that Patailhad arrived at his office on Monday morning expecting to finalisethe extremely sensitive charges he was preparing against the PrimeMinister, resulting from the investigations of the multi-agencytask force into 1MDB.「He was finalising it. He went to his office and found he couldnot go in. Ali Bin Hamsa, the Chief Secretary to the Government,was waiting and he told him [the Attorney General, Abdul GaniPatail] that he was dismissed. He could not even get hispapers.」Within hours of this secret drama at the heart of government, asall Malaysia knows, the Prime Minister had moved to effect what hasbeen described as an attempted coup detat.Fire on the 10th floor of Bukit Aman last night – it is whereall the documents on white collar crime are kept…. a coincidencepeople are asking?The head of Special Branch was removed, the Deputy PrimeMinister was dumped and four members of the investigatingParliamentary Accounts Committee were elevated without choice topositions in Cabinet and its work was declared suspended.Other known cabinet critics of the the 1MDB scandal have alsobeen unceremoniously dismissed by the Prime Minister.It has been also been announced that tomorrows meeting of theUMNO Supreme Council, representing the key leadership of the rulingparty, has also been cancelled by the Prime Minister.Now all Malaysia knows why the Prime Minister has moved to sackthe countries top legal officers and top politicians.In an irony of perfect timing the Prime Minister is now seekingto use the visit of Britains David Cameron as an endorsement ofhis unconstitutional move to hijack the State of Malaysia."
