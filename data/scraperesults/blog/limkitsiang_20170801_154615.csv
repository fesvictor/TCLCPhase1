","{SuperStringhg}{26 July 2017}{1:24 pm} Najib is talking to a group of investors, not kampong folks. Investors have good knowledge of things around their interests. Having heard Najib’s speech, probable questions are:
1. His AG Apandi found no wrong in 1MDB but not Najib admitted “lapses”, so who is lying?
2. Najib mentioned unprecedented investigations but in the end, who got charge – NONE! That showed investigations were for show (in fact, all investigations were shut down once it get to hot)
3. As Najib is the sole signatory of any investments, and he admitted lapses, he must review what are those lapses – are the lapses as bad as US DOJ report?
4. Investors will like to know whether Najib taken any bribes over the France Scorpene scandal because this will affect their investment decision. They need proof not getting his best friend AG Apandi to clear him of another wrongdoing.
5. Investors also like to know why Najib did not sue the other foreign agencies on the many scandals that Malaysia is alleged to commit to clear the good name of Malaysia. As it stands now, Malaysia is crowned as World Kleptocratic Country. This definitely will not be good for foreign investments.
If Najib can answer all these with facts and figures to show his Government has been slandered, investors will be more than happy to invest in this country rich in resources!",,,,,,,,

Yes, DAP MPs or YBs are good, but they openly challenge and provoke the hornets nest, and got arrested for ‘seditious’ acts and what not. While we respect your bravery, why take a selfie until you fall off a cliff?
We support your fight, but we cannot afford to see your MPs and lawyers busy with court cases.
I believe that, DAP, or PH should strategize how to win the peoples heart, not 1MDB story, but basic daily matters.
The difficulty of registering a business, would PH change that if you win?
Changing of car ownership from father to son also need to go through Puspakom. Things like that.
Of course GST is seriously causing small family business to wind up.
Will PH bring down prices of daily needs if you win?
How? Last election campaign, Superman KY said, if PH wins, the price of a Toyota Vios will be at the price of a Myvi.

Mainstream media practitioners should stop their hypocrisy belly-aching about “fake news” on social media when they are themselves the  worst purveyor of false news,20170111,1 Comment,{Bigjoe}{14 January 2017}{2:52 pm} Its normal for banana democracy like ours to have propaganda mainstream media that have no idea they are wrong but how do you explain an MCA Minister like Liow Tiong Lai who says the Vehicle Entry Permit of Singapore is the same as our RC when he knows as Transport Minister that VEP is the COE counterpart for foreign vehicle meant to control vehicle population in Singapore whereas the RC Malaysia charge is purely revenue generation to pay for the roads they want?,,,,,,,,,
Barack Obama legacy: Did he improve US race relations?,20170111,2 Comments,"{good coolie}{11 January 2017}{1:04 pm} Byrant’s article is informative and unbiased. I wish the writer had had the benefit of Obama’s latest, and last, speech to the nation where Obama adumbrated the citizen’s responsibility to the nation and its democratic principles. That speech was inspiring  to the “brown’ and black citizens of the U.S;  it was also understanding of the “white” people who voted the Democrats out of all three political institutions of importance. Obama also stressed the deleterious role of misinformation and outright lies which were characterised the recent U.S. election campaign.",{good coolie}{11 January 2017}{1:05 pm} “which characterised the recent U.S. elections”.,,,,,,,,

Ultimately, the problem of Najib strategy is not MCA or even MIC breaking rank over Hudud but Sarawak and Sabah BN leaders.  It’s no longer tenable to allow Sarawakians and Sabahan to say it’s not their problem. RUU 355 goes to the heart of  what Sarawakian and Sabahan are.

We look to our leaders to lead us out of this abyss. We pray for strength for them to persevere against all odds, and show us the way out of this dark tunnel. Alas, in 2017, there is a light at the end of this dark tunnel. Lets us hope that it is the light that will lead us to salvation, and not the light of an on coming train, at full speed to crush us.  Alas we hope, as we have nothing left but hope, hope that salvation is nigh.",,,,,,,,,
