if pas still in coalition then better vote bn

lol when ge still kalah to bn...no use.

https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/387293malays today view umno as being more of a threat to them, compared to dap, claimed former umno minister zainuddin maidin.in his latest blog posting, zainuddin said dap, which has been labelled chauvinistic, has now matured politically, is progressive, clean and efficient, and free from "narrow" religious sentiments."more malays are seeing and understanding that the threat to malay nationalism no longer comes from dap, which wants to 'malaysianise' the country, but from umno, which wants to 'chinanise' (menchinakan) malaysia through economic colonialism...-------------------------for the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only rm150 a year (full news access)

since when dap threatened malay?

actually tan sri zam maidin here is the worse person to show support to dap.i mean, we can't forget almost 10 years ago he had that awful interview with aljazeera on the eve of the 1st bersih ('malaysia has erections every 5 years")...vmfy1-z2lk0politics make strange bedfellows indeed.

dap cant do much as most of the population in malaysia are bumi... most of the bumi still have the mindset that dap is a racist party that trying to take over malaysia.

no longer a threat but still everything  salahkan dap , nampak tak racist bn

nah.. i don't vote pas. just want to give an example, some perspective. but.. frankly, i would rather support tok guru hadi into power than dap.

lel yeah, usd700 million in personal acct is donation from saudi king. and that's why vote pas is better than dap :lol2:

not in relation. but yes. i recommend not voting dap.

do people here even read up on that? share! share.. haha... nanti kit siang buat buat bodoh. claim innocence.

that way, people can see that pas is all about positions and rewards, instead of principles, says pkr vp.

rt @bigdaddydev: @meowphone haha... najib dah jadikan umno mcm freak show.

rt @najibrazak: jangan biarkan panji-panji umno dan malaysia tercinta ini, sesekali jatuh ke tangan musuh dan pengkhianat negara! https://t…

umno dan najib x penting lagi!

najib wajib dikalahkan... umno mesti jatuh!

umno apologists say no political party is clean so budaya korup, makan rasuah dlm umno &amp; kerajaan semuanya ok asalkan geng najib yg buat!

i don't support anwar at all. to me, he is a self serving politician. but frankly, that means he won't let himself be so easily taken advantage of by other parties in the coalition, and could later on change his stance regarding certain things that he advocate. particularly, matters regarding bumis. but i am an ardent supporter of pm najib, hence umno has my vote.
