cukur bn, terima kasih najib.turun liao.
if bn and najib collapse, then no way thailand can surpass malaysia
you are extremely less intelligent. no data supports your statement. thailand has unstable politics, low gdp growth rate, low innovation index.if thailand has stable politics, china would have invested hundred of billion of dollars to build kra canal. there is a possibility vietnam might become a developed country prior thailand in year 2040.malaysia is expected to register gdp growth rate of a minimum of 5% this year.we are poised to become a developed country in 2020. look at imf and world bank forecast and reports. our pemandu's economic transformation plan is a model for middle income trap countries to escape their state.ringgit is the best performing currency in the world this year against usd.our budget deficit is narrowing since 2009. should be less than 3% this year.we should get a credit rating increase after the ge(which is due by august 2018)bn is expected to win majority and retain government(not even one single international agency would dispute this).we are registering record high fdi flowing into country. malaysia is snapping almost all singapore economic roles in south east asia. next in line: financial hub of asean. tun razak exchange first phase should be completed by 2020.we are expected to register 5-6% gdp growth p.a. between 2020-2030 ( highest among any developed countries in the world).we are rising in innovation index since najib took over in 2009. our university rankings have been steadily increasing. our 15 year old education(form 3) has been reformed. we should be getting a boost in pisa score.malaysia has been named the best destination for investment by us news.our economic freedom index has been rising .we are expected to be a highly capitalist country.the opportunity that malaysia promises once aec comes into fruition in 2025 is enormous.there is only one thing we are doing moderately: no decrease in corruption index.
and do u knw msia has been performing at the lowest ever since najib become prime minister ?? its enuff to put msia in the last in these few years , forget abt previous forecast when our currency is still remain strongin just 2 years i can see sooo much diff btwn thai and msia.....i hv been goin to bkk for at least twice every year...each time visit is an eye opening for me..that amount of rapid development..well lets forget abt our currency exchange which is shit , other than that by looking at their city/town development/ the amount of tourist / their innovatives in marketing / f&b / hotels /etc so much better than msia ...just give them a couple more years they will definitely above us heck even i started seeing more and more msian peeps bringing in thai products to sell in shop / pasar malam , copying their ideas and others
i don't support anwar at all. to me, he is a self serving politician. but frankly, that means he won't let himself be so easily taken advantage of by other parties in the coalition, and could later on change his stance regarding certain things that he advocate. particularly, matters regarding bumis. but i am an ardent supporter of pm najib, hence umno has my vote.
sounds to me u only accept statement that's align with pm's ideathen perhaps u shouldnt use dap and pas..jst say najib way or non-najib way..easier for ppl to understand where s ur goal post
and so coming from one who believes usd700 million in personal act is donation from saudi king, you also recommend vote bn/ najib and don't vote dap. got it
yes, i mean this country, now under further malay governance. and with najib. not tun m, kit siang and those other cartoon characters.oh i guess you don't. it just seems like...
yeah, if only they know. imo just haramkan terus dap. dah 5 tahun ros suruh buat pilihanraya parti yang baru tapi degil. diorang yang menipu nak menang pastu salahkan najib plak?
my previous thread commenting on these issues were taken down. bear with me. we cannot condemn the government for corruption or mishandling of nation's wealth when we the so called "rakyat" reject legitimate systems like gst. and want magic money like tun's time. we cannot borrow like before for our country's developments(infrastructure projects,etc..). we are heavily in debt. when pak lah took over, he stopped that nonsense. and when najib took office, he introduced gst. a legitimate taxing system used by many other countries.btw, i've got a question regarding how christians see jesus as. shall i ask?
