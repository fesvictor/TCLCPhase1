#letters kamarul zaman yusof’s false and malicious police report against selangor state assembly speaker and dap assemblyperson for subang jaya, hannah yeoh, accusing her of proselytisation of muslims with the publication of her autobiography ‘being hannah’, raises the question whether he is fit and proper to be a lecturer of plural malaysia’s public universities
a dap orang asal politician says his state's rights in the federation is slowly being eroded.
video | kinitv: dap secretary-general lim guan eng has questioned why selangor speaker hannah yeoh was being persecuted for speaking about her own faith as a christian.
video | kinitv: parti amanah negara (amanah) today defended dap's subang jaya asssemblyperson, following allegations that she is proselytising christianity through her book "becoming hannah".
the dap veteran also sheds doubts on pas' ambition to capture five states, especially pahang and selangor.
video | kinitv: dap leader lim guan eng says pas' three state executive councillors in selangor should resign after the party decided to cut ties with pkr.
this is in connection with najib's second defamation suit against the dap national publicity secretary.
video | kinitv: attorney-general mohamed apandi ali says he does not dare to comment on the disqualification of dap pujut assemblyperson ting tiong choon, citing he wasn't sure about the facts."the law is clear, but i am not sure about the facts," he said when met at the 17th asean senior law officials meeting (aslom) in putrajaya today.
adun speaks | it’s an absolute disgrace for pas to scapegoat dap, using what is common umno-speak.
it is contesting nine seats in the federal territories, including those held by pkr and dap.
abang johari isn't perturbed by dap's claim the state's move goes against the court ruling on ting tiong choon.
dap secretary-general shocked by the decision of the sarawak state assembly to disqualify ting.
selangor dap chief tony pua amused by decision of selangor pas to stay with the state government after breaking ties with pkr.
umno president najib abdul razak marked the party’s 71st anniversary by taking a swipe at a former party leader, while praising pas president abdul hadi awangnajib said none could have imagined how this former leader could have betrayed the party and colluded with its old foe, dap.read more: https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/381940 photos by lim huey teng
‘we did not forget who taught us that dap was a racist chauvinist party,’ he says.
the illegal workers should be treated as human trafficking victims, says dap lawmakers.
dap veteran wants macc chief to explain if he will walk the talk to fight the corruption scourge and act against the 1mdb scandal.
the finance ministry must come clean on 1mdb president arul kanda kandasamy’s sudden removal from key positions in bandar malaysia sdn bhd and trx city sdn bhd, said a dap leader.

appreciate your help man.i called the police station they told me to wait 14 days and call them back for get the keputusan siasatan.but on the day i made the police report, the sergeant actually told me to repair it myself, no need claim insurance.i told him i would claim od kfk/third party, he said "nak claim insurance mungkin tak dapat ni, tapi u cuba la".well, finger crossed.
its not about whether suitable or not, its just we don't want to adapt.japan has corruption but still they are able to do perfect maintanence. during mamakthir time, he used to say look east concept. but japanese people are crazy about maintenance and repair in their kanzen policies. so why are we ignoring these stuffs? all we just want to do is to buy big but maintenance is poor. i am no military expert but why mig 29n we bought in the 1990s need to be replace??? its just puzzling. the americans use their b-52 from 1950s till today. some pilots even say their dads used to be pilots in the same plane.

https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/387293malays today view umno as being more of a threat to them, compared to dap, claimed former umno minister zainuddin maidin.in his latest blog posting, zainuddin said dap, which has been labelled chauvinistic, has now matured politically, is progressive, clean and efficient, and free from "narrow" religious sentiments."more malays are seeing and understanding that the threat to malay nationalism no longer comes from dap, which wants to 'malaysianise' the country, but from umno, which wants to 'chinanise' (menchinakan) malaysia through economic colonialism...-------------------------for the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only rm150 a year (full news access)
pfffft. the threat is not dap
since when dap threatened malay?
actually tan sri zam maidin here is the worse person to show support to dap.i mean, we can't forget almost 10 years ago he had that awful interview with aljazeera on the eve of the 1st bersih ('malaysia has erections every 5 years")...vmfy1-z2lk0politics make strange bedfellows indeed.
dap cant do much as most of the population in malaysia are bumi... most of the bumi still have the mindset that dap is a racist party that trying to take over malaysia.
umno lost their cainis carddeswai cepat2 de register dap
another one makan dedak daphaiiih
no longer a threat but still everything  salahkan dap , nampak tak racist bn
don't you worry my dear lil pork eater. under malay governance, this country will rise to greater heights(god willing), the likes of dap could never hope to achieve.don't you worry. there's just this minor setback with oil prices. with gst we are among the slowest to implement. and we also need to correct our previous ways under tun m, when he borrowed money like a china gambling man. thanks for the support. i believe we could exchange racial jokes in good conscience? thanks.(*edit* gst is a legit taxing system implemented around the world anyway, and we are among the lowest.)
nah.. i don't vote pas. just want to give an example, some perspective. but.. frankly, i would rather support tok guru hadi into power than dap.
1. jew=2. dap
lel yeah, usd700 million in personal acct is donation from saudi king. and that's why vote pas is better than dap :lol2:
sounds to me u only accept statement that's align with pm's ideathen perhaps u shouldnt use dap and pas..jst say najib way or non-najib way..easier for ppl to understand where s ur goal post
yes. i have stated many times before that i support our pm. and am also against dap. i think there isn't a problem with mentioning both of my stances? or is it better not to mention opposition?  don't you worry my dear lil pork eater. under malay governance, this country will rise to greater heights(god willing), the likes of dap could never hope to achieve.don't you worry. there's just this minor setback with oil prices. with gst we are among the slowest to implement. and we also need to correct our previous ways under tun m, when he borrowed money like a china gambling man. thanks for the support. i believe we could exchange racial jokes in good conscience? thanks.(*edit* gst is a legit taxing system implemented around the world anyway, and we are among the lowest.)
and so coming from one who believes usd700 million in personal act is donation from saudi king, you also recommend vote bn/ najib and don't vote dap. got it
not in relation. but yes. i recommend not voting dap.
i dun get this guy. why can't he say dap is no longer a threat to bn??? why must he mention racing?come on, man. we are no longer in the dark ages, we are a united nation.
naah, just pointing out to ppl no need to argue about voting dap with one who believes usd700 million in personal acct is donation from saudi king...seriously though... usd700 million in personal account... is donation... from saudi king
u guys have no idea how many high educated malays working in mnc hates umno but still dont want dap to take overit is quite high apparently
yeah, if only they know. imo just haramkan terus dap. dah 5 tahun ros suruh buat pilihanraya parti yang baru tapi degil. diorang yang menipu nak menang pastu salahkan najib plak?
pot calling the kettle black, dap punya ko percaya walaupun telus di jelas? hati dah gelap?sometime when i see post mcm ni..i cringe.
