if bn and najib collapse, then no way thailand can surpass malaysia
you are extremely less intelligent. no data supports your statement. thailand has unstable politics, low gdp growth rate, low innovation index.if thailand has stable politics, china would have invested hundred of billion of dollars to build kra canal. there is a possibility vietnam might become a developed country prior thailand in year 2040.malaysia is expected to register gdp growth rate of a minimum of 5% this year.we are poised to become a developed country in 2020. look at imf and world bank forecast and reports. our pemandu's economic transformation plan is a model for middle income trap countries to escape their state.ringgit is the best performing currency in the world this year against usd.our budget deficit is narrowing since 2009. should be less than 3% this year.we should get a credit rating increase after the ge(which is due by august 2018)bn is expected to win majority and retain government(not even one single international agency would dispute this).we are registering record high fdi flowing into country. malaysia is snapping almost all singapore economic roles in south east asia. next in line: financial hub of asean. tun razak exchange first phase should be completed by 2020.we are expected to register 5-6% gdp growth p.a. between 2020-2030 ( highest among any developed countries in the world).we are rising in innovation index since najib took over in 2009. our university rankings have been steadily increasing. our 15 year old education(form 3) has been reformed. we should be getting a boost in pisa score.malaysia has been named the best destination for investment by us news.our economic freedom index has been rising .we are expected to be a highly capitalist country.the opportunity that malaysia promises once aec comes into fruition in 2025 is enormous.there is only one thing we are doing moderately: no decrease in corruption index.

i dun get this guy. why can't he say dap is no longer a threat to bn??? why must he mention racing?come on, man. we are no longer in the dark ages, we are a united nation.
