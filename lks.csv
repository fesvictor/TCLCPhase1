The “overkill” campaign to convince Malaysians that 1MDB scandal has finally been resolved with the 1MDB-IPIC “arbitration settlement” boomeranged as many basic questions remain unanswered,04/27/17,2 Comments,"{SuperStringhg}{27 April 2017}{12:17 pm} UMNO has 3 million members. 99.9% are quiet over all those missing funds because the same 99.9% probably believe that those funds are used to fight ISIS and pay voters to ensure UMNO wins elections. The same 99.9% therefore believe that the US DOJ report must be a fabrication to bring down the good government of Malaysia. Yes, only IF the above is true otherwise the 99.9% UMNO members cannot be so quiet over the missing funds and except the fact that they have to pay double (USD6.5Billion) over what they have borrowed(USD3Billion)!!!","{Bigjoe}{28 April 2017}{4:14 am} These “settlement” and going ons in 1MDB are excuse making in reality.

"UMNO/BN leaders and strategists expect UMNO, MCA, Gerakan and MIC to lose more seats in 14GE and this is why they are cranking up their campaign of lies, hate and fear, especially the triple lie-hate-fear tactics that if UMNO loses, the Malays will lose political power",04/23/17,5 Comments,"{FreeAsian}{24 April 2017}{12:12 am} Uncle Lim, you are feared by BN UMNO because they know that a multiracial party is the future for Malaysia.  MO1 cannot afford to lose GE14 because his freedom as a kleptocrat is at stake.","{Bigjoe}{24 April 2017}{5:07 am} Yes, they are lies and slander but the worst of them are the false equivalence. Comparing the issue of RUU 355 with Ahok, comparing Zakir Naik with Khomeini, comparing the monkey in NYSP with Charlie Hebdo and others.","{Bigjoe}{24 April 2017}{5:23 am} Put it another way, Anwar was jailed long before MOST of the details of 1MDB and SRC were known. Today if Anwar was free, Najib would have been gone, Mahathir may not even join Pakatan.  Najib saw way ahead to start his scheming and slander. He takes no chance, he stacks the odds over whelmingly in his favour.","{good coolie}{24 April 2017}{8:42 pm} DAP was strong because the Chinese abandoned Gerakan and MCA to chose DAP.

Najib responsible for the most heinous fake news any government has concocted with the official version that the global kleptocratic 1MDB scandal does not exist,04/21/17,3 Comments,"{Bigjoe}{21 April 2017}{9:43 pm} Najib has done the most heinous but it’s not the fake news of 1MDB but rather the no news on the fact he has pushed this country beyond the point of no return from heading to certain destruction from third rail politics of race, religion unstoppable by the institutions and systems he has broken to cover his crime and failures","{tmc}{23 April 2017}{7:43 am} GE14 definitely coming soon, not later. Putrajaya will do its best to “cripple” the opposition,  hence the oppo must do its best to hunker down and draw up a defence blueprint against all attacks whether in print, media or speeches, hold steadfast in discipline, dont go off half corked in knee jerk reactions to provocative actions or comments.
Syabas to Zairil Khir Johari and Dyana Sofya Mohd Daud because they remained calm and refused to join in the fray.  Thus Putrajaya has fallen into the trap of inviting the Police and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC)  to investigate the people behind the spread of photographs of individuals resembling DAP’s Zairil Khir Johari and Dyana Sofya Mohd Daud on social media.
Same advice to all the leaders in the oppo and supporters, dont be tempted to waste your energies, harness them for the great “battle” GE14, because Putrajaya wants to harass you in court or in the media to take you out of the election.","{Godfather}{25 April 2017}{10:13 am} If the problem of 1MDB doesn’t exist, why does the government have to pay IPIC for a total of RM 26 billion ?

The black swans in Malaysian politics,04/16/17,1 Comment,"{Bigjoe}{16 April 2017}{8:34 pm} Please tell Me. Liew Chin Tong, his understanding of black swan is inaccurate. Black swan events are not just unexpected events. They are events that has a disproportionate effect. In other words, seemingly unimportant things became big. So Mahathir joining with Pakatan is not a black swan nor if Mahathir managed to topple UMNO-PAS.",,,,,,
