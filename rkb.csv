Crying Wolf (on The Wall Street),06/16/17,6 comments,{RD.} Salam Ramadan Dato Rocky.To me... the first thing Apandi or Najib need to do... if they really wanted to show that nothing was wrong in 1MDB is to declassified all reports that have been OSAed.,"{M. Bakri Musa} Few points to bear in mind so as to enlighten your readers as well as to put things in perspective. The DOJ lawsuit is a civil - not criminal - one. The pace of all civil suits in America is glacial, meaning, it is normal for it to take years before coming to trial. For another, the suit is againts the ASSETS, not inviduals. Of course those assets belong to someone, so indirectly it is a suit against their owners.  However if there is a criminal indictment initiated during the process, then the pace would hasten quickly as there is the axiom in law that justice delayed is justice denied. The only reason DOJ can ""campor tangan"" in the matter is because those funds to buy those assets flowed through American banks. Even if Low and Aziz and MO1 could smuggle all those millions in their suitcases and diplomatic puches through the airport, they could still get into trouble.  In America, all cash transactions exceeding $10,000 must be reported to the authorities. So you cannot escape. The central crux of the matter is this:  Where did all the money to acquire those properties come from?  In case of Jho Low one could concieveably believe it was family's wealth through years of hard work by his ancestors, as he claimed. For Reza Aziz?  Wealth from his father? A nondescript Malaysian army officer? Stepfather Najib, who had been government all his adult life? Mother Rosmah is the daugheter of a village school teacher from my kampung in NS. Look at the house where she was born! No weatlh to speak of. However if you believe that some Sheik in Saudi Araba was generous to give Reza hundreds of millions for no apparent reason, as he claimed, then there is some mangrove swamps in Lumut I can sell you.That my friend is the crux of the problem. Until someone can give a better explanation, I believe the DOJ version. Everything else is spin. ","{damansaraman} Assalammualaikum DatoTidak pernah dalam sejarah kita bertindak sebacul ini.

On 22nd April UMNO Malaysia again received two further cheques of RM50 million each.Individual cheques were also handed out to all UMNO and related BN divisions, for example Badan Perhubungan UMNO Negeri Pahang received RM15 million on 18th April and the following day, April 19th, UMNO Penang received RM5 million. Kelantan division received RM5 million on 10th April.Amongst the many other similar payments was RM5 million both the UMNO state party of Kedah and the MCA Selangor Liason Committee on 8th April and RM20 million to UMNO Selangor on April 24th.  UMNO Perak received its handout on April 29th of RM25 million with another five million each going to UMNO Selangor and the MCA Selangor Liason Committee again the following day.  Also on 30th April Johor UMNO received RM25 million, less than a week before the election.The UMNO womens’ divisions also received significant pay outs, signifying the party’s appreciation of the importance of ‘winning’ the female vote: Pergerakan Puteri UMNO Malaysia received a RM5 million cheque 27th February and Pergerakan Wanita UMNO Selangor RM1.1 million 22nd March and Wanita Barisan Nasional Selangor RM1 million on 17th May.Allied parties also received big money, for example the Liberal Democratic Party received RM1 million 5th April, the Malaysian Indian Congress received RM10 million on the 18th April and a further RM5 million 26th April. SUPP received RM2 million 20th March.  The previous year UPCO had received RM2 million, indeed over the election huge sums were dished out to Sabah and particularly Sarawak (of which more later).Saudi storySince all this money came from stolen public funds, borrowed at punishing rates of interest under false pretenses, the ultimate cost to the Malaysian taxpayer will be at least double the sums handed out in this exercise to buy votes for the ruling party, who was abusing its position in such a spectacular fashion.People are entitled to assume that a man who is willing to raid his country’s development fund, as well as the civil servant pension fund, the pilgrims’ fund, the farmers’ fund and doubtless other sources of public money, is unlikely to hesitate to attempt to bribe voters with a little of that money back in the form of payment for votes.","{Anonymous} If Najib has to keep stepping in to every ego driven mistake, it does serve any purpose to gave Ministers and government representative Chairmen.",,,,,,,,,

"My Sabah, Our Sabah",05/03/17,1 comment,"{Tunku Aziz} Federations have a poor record of keeping states happily together for any length of time. The British union of England, Scotland and Wales is going through a stressful period and how much longer will Scotland remain in the family? Think of other federations that are now all but forgotten: The West Indian Federation, the East African Federation, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, to name a few. In their modern form,federations were a British invention, used as a simple expedient for washing their hands off a difficult imperial political problem.We in the Malay Peninsula should take pride in nurturing Sabah into a modern state, a far cry from the days when I was sent out to the then British North Borneo to teach at Sabah College.We have prepared them well and we must set them free if this is what the people of Sabah really want. A referendum supervised by an international team should decide the matter once and for all. The same goes for Sarawak.Let them leave the nest. Freedom is their birthright. ",,,,,,,,,,,

You are becoming as moronic as your dedak giver....hehe,{arizmaya} no comment allowed?,"{xnakdedak} Whatever qualifications were achieved by Mohd Puad Zakarshi, they plainly did not demand logic.Because, the settlement by 1MDB doesn’t undermine the DOJ case, to the contrary it confirms it. Period.If 1MDB had really paid $3.5 billion in ‘guarantee deposits’ to IPIC, as Najib continues to laughably claim, then Malaysia would never have lost the arbitration case and been forced to pay back the $1.2 billion that IPIC later bailed them out with.Instead, the court would have pointed out that the bail out was just a third of the up-front deposit and IPIC would actually still have over $2 billion of 1MDB’s money left.This is not what has happened.  The settlement involves an agreement by 1MDB to pay back the bail out money and to take over the responsibility for the remainder of its debts.It is therefore a concrete admission by Malaysia that it could not prove its claims that it had deposited a single cent let alone billions with IPIC.And that means that the money trails supplied by the DOJ investigations, showing instead that all the money was siphoned off into a bogus BVI account to pay for Jho Low, Rosmah and Khadem Al Qubaisi’s fun and frolics, has been confirmed by the settlement and not weakened.It is plain as daylight, yet this Minister of Disinformation is attempting to say the opposite. How stupid does he think people are in Malaysia?He is also asking people to believe that the payment is going to come from the ‘monetisation’ of non-existant ‘units’ that 1MDB also doesnt have, because all the PetroSaudi money was funnelled into another off-shore company (Good Star Limited) and stolen as well.Puad says we should believe his story because the PM’s office said it (just like they said IPIC received money which it didn’t).So, who is going to believe this illogical and mendacious fellow when he goes on to say that Najib won’t be touching taxpayer’s funds to repay the debt?Is there a single voter who believes that?","{Hantu Gigi Jarang} Rocky, for once, tenguklah balik bumi yang kau pijak dan langit yang kau junjung.
