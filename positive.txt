PAS untuk semua....., except for Husam...

Vodte BN guys, vote BNIs this rubbish that you guys want to lead the country?Oh pleasee.So many people cacing kepanasan.

we support progress.pas not .that why i hate pas and support bn.

better support dap than pas.at least bolehland will become like singapore than Bangladesh.

i just support dap just what /k ppl want.

I LOVE hadi and pas

dr M iz the lesser evil... 4 nao

voting PAS.dont care

This line up is powerful enough to topple BN. Under wan azizah as the new pm and tun M as advisor should be able to make the country prosper again. Anwar and rafizi should be back after PH wins the next ge. We have good leadershin in PH. Still hope

Will vote for PAS or DAP if they in my area..if BN PAN Bersatu PKR I'm no vote..undi rosak..

I put my bet on Zaid Ibrahim..

Rafizi should be our PM! He's the only young blood capable
