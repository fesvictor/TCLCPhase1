# TCLC Phase 1
#
This is the repo for the first phase for TCLC project
involving basic parsing and visualization of scraping results

 There are three folders in the master branch.   
 
 data - contains the output from the scraping component (currently in csv and json format) as well as phrases for categorizing this  output  
 
 temp - contains  the output from the analysis component that will subsequently be used by the visualization component.  
 
 results - contains the output from the visualization component

 
There are 3 text files (instructions for xxxx.txt), where xxxx is analysis, scraping and visualization. This should provide instructions for running these 3 components; for e.g. what Python libraries to import, any setup required, etc. It should be completed by the developers responsible for each of these components.
 
 There are 3 branches in addition to the master branch which correspond to each of these 3 components (analysis, scraping and visualization). All code development should be confined to these branches until it has been tested to be working for a specific features. Then issue a pull-request and I will merge the required branch into the master branch.
